The old lady pulled her spectacles\\r\\ndown and looked over them about the room; then she\\r\\nput them up and looked out under them.  She seldom\\r\\nor never looked through them for so small a thing\\r\\nas a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her\\r\\nheart, and were built for “style,” not\\r\\nservice ­she could have seen through a pair\\r\\nof stove-lids just as well.  She looked perplexed\\r\\nfor a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still\\r\\nloud enough for the furniture to hear:  “Well, I lay if I get hold of you I’ll ­” She did not finish, for by this time\\r\\nshe was bending down and punching under the bed with\\r\\nthe broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the\\r\\npunches with.  She resurrected nothing but the\\r\\ncat. “I never did see the beat of that boy!” She went to the open door and stood\\r\\nin it and looked out among the tomato vines and “jimpson”\\r\\nweeds that constituted the garden.  No Tom. \\r\\nSo she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for\\r\\ndistance and shouted:  “Y-o-u-u Tom!” There was a slight noise behind her\\r\\nand she turned just in time to seize a small boy by\\r\\nthe slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight. “There!  I might ‘a’\\r\\nthought of that closet.  What you been doing in\\r\\nthere?” “Nothing.” “Nothing!  Look at your\\r\\nhands.  And look at your mouth.  What is\\r\\nthat truck?” “I don’t know, aunt.” “Well, I know.  It’s\\r\\njam ­that’s what it is.  Forty\\r\\ntimes I’ve said if you didn’t let that\\r\\njam alone I’d skin you.  Hand me that switch.” The switch hovered in the air ­the peril\\r\\nwas desperate ­ “My!  Look behind you, aunt!” The old lady whirled round, and snatched\\r\\nher skirts out of danger.  The lad fled on the\\r\\ninstant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and disappeared\\r\\nover it. His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment,\\r\\nand then broke into a gentle laugh. “Hang the boy, can’t I\\r\\nnever learn anything?  Ain’t he played me\\r\\ntricks enough like that for me to be looking out for\\r\\nhim by this time?  But old fools is the biggest\\r\\nfools there is.  Can’t learn an old dog new\\r\\ntricks, as the saying is.  But my goodness, he\\r\\nnever plays them alike, two days, and how is a body\\r\\nto know what’s coming?  He ’pears to\\r\\nknow just how long he can torment me before I get\\r\\nmy dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put\\r\\nme off for a minute or make me laugh, it’s all\\r\\ndown again and I can’t hit him a lick. \\r\\nI ain’t doing my duty by that boy, and that’s\\r\\nthe Lord’s truth, goodness knows.  Spare\\r\\nthe rod and spile the child, as the Good Book says. \\r\\nI’m a laying up sin and suffering for us both,\\r\\nI know.  He’s full of the Old Scratch, but\\r\\nlaws-a-me! he’s my own dead sister’s boy,\\r\\npoor thing, and I ain’t got the heart to lash\\r\\nhim, somehow.  Every time I let him off, my conscience\\r\\ndoes hurt me so, and every time I hit him my old heart\\r\\nmost breaks.  Well-a-well, man that is born of\\r\\nwoman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture\\r\\nsays, and I reckon it’s so.  He’ll\\r\\nplay hookey this evening,  and [ Southwestern for\\r\\n“afternoon”] I’ll just be obleeged\\r\\nto make him work, to-morrow, to punish him.  It’s\\r\\nmighty hard to make him work Saturdays, when all the\\r\\nboys is having holiday, but he hates work more than\\r\\nhe hates anything else, and I’ve got to\\r\\ndo some of my duty by him, or I’ll be the ruination\\r\\nof the child.” Tom did play hookey, and he had a\\r\\nvery good time.  He got back home barely in season\\r\\nto help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day’s\\r\\nwood and split the kindlings before supper ­at\\r\\nleast he was there in time to tell his adventures\\r\\nto Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work. \\r\\nTom’s younger brother (or rather half-brother)\\r\\nSid was already through with his part of the work\\r\\n(picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy, and had\\r\\nno adventurous, troublesome ways. While Tom was eating his supper, and\\r\\nstealing sugar as opportunity offered, Aunt Polly\\r\\nasked him questions that were full of guile, and very\\r\\ndeep ­for she wanted to trap him into damaging\\r\\nrevealments.  Like many other simple-hearted souls,\\r\\nit was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with\\r\\na talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she\\r\\nloved to contemplate her most transparent devices as\\r\\nmarvels of low cunning.  Said she:  “Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn’t\\r\\nit?” “Yes’m.” “Powerful warm, warn’t it?” “Yes’m.” “Didn’t you want to go in a-swimming,\\r\\nTom?” A bit of a scare shot through Tom ­a\\r\\ntouch of uncomfortable suspicion.  He searched\\r\\nAunt Polly’s face, but it told him nothing. \\r\\nSo he said:  “No’m ­well, not very much.” The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom’s\\r\\nshirt, and said:  “But you ain’t too warm\\r\\nnow, though.”  And it flattered her to reflect\\r\\nthat she had discovered that the shirt was dry without\\r\\nanybody knowing that that was what she had in her\\r\\nmind.  But in spite of her, Tom knew where the\\r\\nwind lay, now.  So he forestalled what might be\\r\\nthe next move:  “Some of us pumped on our heads ­mine’s\\r\\ndamp yet.  See?” Aunt Polly was vexed to think she\\r\\nhad overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence,\\r\\nand missed a trick.  Then she had a new inspiration:  “Tom, you didn’t have\\r\\nto undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump\\r\\non your head, did you?  Unbutton your jacket!” The trouble vanished out of Tom’s\\r\\nface.  He opened his jacket.  His shirt collar\\r\\nwas securely sewed. “Bother!  Well, go ’long\\r\\nwith you.  I’d made sure you’d played\\r\\nhookey and been a-swimming.  But I forgive ye,\\r\\nTom.  I reckon you’re a kind of a singed\\r\\ncat, as the saying is ­better’n you\\r\\nlook.  This time.” She was half sorry her sagacity had\\r\\nmiscarried, and half glad that Tom had stumbled into\\r\\nobedient conduct for once. But Sidney said:  “Well, now, if I didn’t\\r\\nthink you sewed his collar with white thread, but\\r\\nit’s black.” “Why, I did sew it with white!  Tom!” But Tom did not wait for the rest.  As he went\\r\\nout at the door he said:  “Siddy, I’ll lick you for that.” In a safe place Tom examined two large\\r\\nneedles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket,\\r\\nand had thread bound about them ­one needle\\r\\ncarried white thread and the other black.  He said:  “She’d never noticed if\\r\\nit hadn’t been for Sid.  Confound it! sometimes\\r\\nshe sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with\\r\\nblack.  I wish to geeminy she’d stick to\\r\\none or t’other ­I can’t keep\\r\\nthe run of ’em.  But I bet you I’ll\\r\\nlam Sid for that.  I’ll learn him!” He was not the Model Boy of the village. \\r\\nHe knew the model boy very well though ­and\\r\\nloathed him. Within two minutes, or even less,\\r\\nhe had forgotten all his troubles.  Not because\\r\\nhis troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to\\r\\nhim than a man’s are to a man, but because a\\r\\nnew and powerful interest bore them down and drove\\r\\nthem out of his mind for the time ­just as\\r\\nmen’s misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement\\r\\nof new enterprises.  This new interest was a valued\\r\\nnovelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from\\r\\na negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. \\r\\nIt consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of\\r\\nliquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to\\r\\nthe roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst\\r\\nof the music ­the reader probably remembers\\r\\nhow to do it, if he has ever been a boy.  Diligence\\r\\nand attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he\\r\\nstrode down the street with his mouth full of harmony\\r\\nand his soul full of gratitude.  He felt much as\\r\\nan astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet ­no\\r\\ndoubt, as far as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure\\r\\nis concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not\\r\\nthe astronomer. The summer evenings were long. \\r\\nIt was not dark, yet.  Presently Tom checked his\\r\\nwhistle.  A stranger was before him ­a\\r\\nboy a shade larger than himself.  A new-comer\\r\\nof any age or either sex was an impressive curiosity\\r\\nin the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. \\r\\nThis boy was well dressed, too ­well dressed\\r\\non a week-day.  This was simply astounding. \\r\\nHis cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue\\r\\ncloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his\\r\\npantaloons.  He had shoes on ­and it\\r\\nwas only Friday.  He even wore a necktie, a bright\\r\\nbit of ribbon.  He had a citified air about him\\r\\nthat ate into Tom’s vitals.  The more Tom\\r\\nstared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned\\r\\nup his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier\\r\\nhis own outfit seemed to him to grow.  Neither\\r\\nboy spoke.  If one moved, the other moved ­but\\r\\nonly sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face\\r\\nand eye to eye all the time.  Finally Tom said:  “I can lick you!” “I’d like to see you try it.” “Well, I can do it.” “No you can’t, either.” “Yes I can.” “No you can’t.” “I can.” “You can’t.” “Can!” “Can’t!” An uncomfortable pause.  Then Tom said:  “What’s your name?” “’Tisn’t any of your business, maybe.” “Well I ’low I’ll make it my\\r\\nbusiness.” “Well why don’t you?” “If you say much, I will.” “Much ­much ­much. \\r\\nThere now.” “Oh, you think you’re\\r\\nmighty smart, don’t you?  I could lick\\r\\nyou with one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.” “Well why don’t you do it?  You\\r\\nsay you can do it.” “Well I will, if you fool with me.” “Oh yes ­I’ve seen whole families\\r\\nin the same fix.” “Smarty!  You think you’re some,\\r\\nnow, don’t you?  Oh, what a hat!” “You can lump that hat if you\\r\\ndon’t like it.  I dare you to knock it off ­and\\r\\nanybody that’ll take a dare will suck eggs.” “You’re a liar!” “You’re another.” “You’re a fighting liar and dasn’t\\r\\ntake it up.” “Aw ­take a walk!” “Say ­if you give\\r\\nme much more of your sass I’ll take and bounce\\r\\na rock off’n your head.” “Oh, of course you will.” “Well I will.” “Well why don’t you do\\r\\nit then?  What do you keep saying you will\\r\\nfor?  Why don’t you do it?  It’s\\r\\nbecause you’re afraid.” “I ain’t afraid.” “You are.” “I ain’t.” “You are.” Another pause, and more eying and\\r\\nsidling around each other.  Presently they were\\r\\nshoulder to shoulder.  Tom said:  “Get away from here!” “Go away yourself!” “I won’t.” “I won’t either.” So they stood, each with a foot placed\\r\\nat an angle as a brace, and both shoving with might\\r\\nand main, and glowering at each other with hate. \\r\\nBut neither could get an advantage.  After struggling\\r\\ntill both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain\\r\\nwith watchful caution, and Tom said:  “You’re a coward and a\\r\\npup.  I’ll tell my big brother on you, and\\r\\nhe can thrash you with his little finger, and I’ll\\r\\nmake him do it, too.” “What do I care for your big\\r\\nbrother?  I’ve got a brother that’s\\r\\nbigger than he is ­and what’s more,\\r\\nhe can throw him over that fence, too.” [Both\\r\\nbrothers were imaginary.] “That’s a lie.” “Your saying so don’t make it so.” Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and\\r\\nsaid:  “I dare you to step over that,\\r\\nand I’ll lick you till you can’t stand\\r\\nup.  Anybody that’ll take a dare will steal\\r\\nsheep.” The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:  “Now you said you’d do it, now let’s\\r\\nsee you do it.” “Don’t you crowd me now; you better look\\r\\nout.” “Well, you said you’d do it ­why\\r\\ndon’t you do it?” “By jingo! for two cents I will do it.” The new boy took two broad coppers\\r\\nout of his pocket and held them out with derision. \\r\\nTom struck them to the ground.  In an instant both\\r\\nboys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped\\r\\ntogether like cats; and for the space of a minute\\r\\nthey tugged and tore at each other’s hair and\\r\\nclothes, punched and scratched each other’s nose,\\r\\nand covered themselves with dust and glory.  Presently\\r\\nthe confusion took form, and through the fog of battle\\r\\nTom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding\\r\\nhim with his fists.  “Holler ’nuff!”\\r\\nsaid he. The boy only struggled to free himself.  He was\\r\\ncrying ­mainly from rage. “Holler ’nuff!” ­and the\\r\\npounding went on. At last the stranger got out a smothered\\r\\n“’Nuff!” and Tom let him up and\\r\\nsaid:  “Now that’ll learn you. \\r\\nBetter look out who you’re fooling with next\\r\\ntime.” The new boy went off brushing the\\r\\ndust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally\\r\\nlooking back and shaking his head and threatening\\r\\nwhat he would do to Tom the “next time he caught\\r\\nhim out.”  To which Tom responded with jeers,\\r\\nand started off in high feather, and as soon as his\\r\\nback was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw\\r\\nit and hit him between the shoulders and then turned\\r\\ntail and ran like an antelope.  Tom chased the\\r\\ntraitor home, and thus found out where he lived. \\r\\nHe then held a position at the gate for some time,\\r\\ndaring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only\\r\\nmade faces at him through the window and declined. \\r\\nAt last the enemy’s mother appeared, and called\\r\\nTom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. \\r\\nSo he went away; but he said he “’lowed”\\r\\nto “lay” for that boy. He got home pretty late that night,\\r\\nand when he climbed cautiously in at the window, he\\r\\nuncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt;\\r\\nand when she saw the state his clothes were in her\\r\\nresolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity\\r\\nat hard labor became adamantine in its firmness.'</span>"

they kept face to face\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand eye to eye all the time.  Finally Tom said:  “I can lick you!” “I’d like to see you try it.” “Well, I can do it.” “No you can’t, either.” “Yes I can.” “No you can’t.” “I can.” “You can’t.” “Can!” “Can’t!” An uncomfortable pause.  Then Tom said:  “What’s your name?” “’Tisn’t any of your business, maybe.” “Well I ’low I’ll make it my\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbusiness.” “Well why don’t you?” “If you say much, I will.” “Much ­much ­much. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThere now.” “Oh, you think you’re\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmighty smart, don’t you?  I could lick\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyou with one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.” “Well why don’t you do it?  You\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsay you can do it.” “Well I will, if you fool with me.” “Oh yes ­I’ve seen whole families\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin the same fix.” “Smarty!  You think you’re some,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnow, don’t you?  Oh, what a hat!” “You can lump that hat if you\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndon’t like it.  I dare you to knock it off ­and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nanybody that’ll take a dare will suck eggs.” “You’re a liar!” “You’re another.” “You’re a fighting liar and dasn’t\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntake it up.” “Aw ­take a walk!” “Say ­if you give\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nme much more of your sass I’ll take and bounce\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na rock off’n your head.” “Oh, of course you will.” “Well I will.” “Well why don’t you do\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit then?  What do you keep saying you will\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor?  Why don’t you do it?  It’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbecause you’re afraid.” “I ain’t afraid.” “You are.” “I ain’t.” “You are.” Another pause, and more eying and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsidling around each other.  Presently they were\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nshoulder to shoulder.  Tom said:  “Get away from here!” “Go away yourself!” “I won’t.” “I won’t either.” So they stood, each with a foot placed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nat an angle as a brace, and both shoving with might\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand main, and glowering at each other with hate. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBut neither could get an advantage.  After struggling\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntill both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith watchful caution, and Tom said:  “You’re a coward and a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npup.  I’ll tell my big brother on you, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe can thrash you with his little finger, and I’ll\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmake him do it, too.” “What do I care for your big\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbrother?  I’ve got a brother that’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbigger than he is ­and what’s more,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe can throw him over that fence, too.” {[}Both\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbrothers were imaginary.{]} “That’s a lie.” “Your saying so don’t make it so.” Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsaid:  “I dare you to step over that,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand I’ll lick you till you can’t stand\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nup.  Anybody that’ll take a dare will steal\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsheep.” The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:  “Now you said you’d do it, now let’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsee you do it.” “Don’t you crowd me now; you better look\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nout.” “Well, you said you’d do it ­why\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndon’t you do it?” “By jingo! for two cents I will do it.” The new boy took two broad coppers\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nout of his pocket and held them out with derision. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nTom struck them to the ground.  In an instant both\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nboys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntogether like cats; and for the space of a minute\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthey tugged and tore at each other’s hair and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nclothes, punched and scratched each other’s nose,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand covered themselves with dust and glory.  Presently\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe confusion took form, and through the fog of battle\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nTom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhim with his fists.  “Holler ’nuff!”\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsaid he. The boy only struggled to free himself.  He was\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncrying ­mainly from rage. “Holler ’nuff!” ­and the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npounding went on. At last the stranger got out a smothered\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n“’Nuff!” and Tom let him up and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsaid:  “Now that’ll learn you. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBetter look out who you’re fooling with next\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntime.” The new boy went off brushing the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlooking back and shaking his head and threatening\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhat he would do to Tom the “next time he caught\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhim out.”  To which Tom responded with jeers,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand started off in high feather, and as soon as his\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nback was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit and hit him between the shoulders and then turned\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntail and ran like an antelope.  Tom chased the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntraitor home, and thus found out where he lived. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHe then held a position at the gate for some time,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndaring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmade faces at him through the window and declined. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAt last the enemy’s mother appeared, and called\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nTom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nSo he went away; but he said he “’lowed”\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto “lay” for that boy.

The old lady pulled her spectacles\\r\\ndown and looked over them about the room; then she\\r\\nput them up and looked out under them.  She seldom\\r\\nor never looked through them for so small a thing\\r\\nas a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her\\r\\nheart, and were built for “style,” not\\r\\nservice ­she could have seen through a pair\\r\\nof stove-lids just as well.  She looked perplexed\\r\\nfor a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still\\r\\nloud enough for the furniture to hear:  “Well, I lay if I get hold of you I’ll ­” She did not finish, for by this time\\r\\nshe was bending down and punching under the bed with\\r\\nthe broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the\\r\\npunches with.  She resurrected nothing but the\\r\\ncat. “I never did see the beat of that boy!” She went to the open door and stood\\r\\nin it and looked out among the tomato vines and “jimpson”\\r\\nweeds that constituted the garden.  No Tom. \\r\\nSo she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for\\r\\ndistance and shouted:  “Y-o-u-u Tom!” There was a slight noise behind her\\r\\nand she turned just in time to seize a small boy by\\r\\nthe slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight. “There!  I might ‘a’\\r\\nthought of that closet.  What you been doing in\\r\\nthere?” “Nothing.” “Nothing!  Look at your\\r\\nhands.  And look at your mouth.  What is\\r\\nthat truck?” “I don’t know, aunt.” “Well, I know.  It’s\\r\\njam ­that’s what it is.  Forty\\r\\ntimes I’ve said if you didn’t let that\\r\\njam alone I’d skin you.  Hand me that switch.” The switch hovered in the air ­the peril\\r\\nwas desperate ­ “My!  Look behind you, aunt!” The old lady whirled round, and snatched\\r\\nher skirts out of danger.  The lad fled on the\\r\\ninstant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and disappeared\\r\\nover it. His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment,\\r\\nand then broke into a gentle laugh. “Hang the boy, can’t I\\r\\nnever learn anything?  Ain’t he played me\\r\\ntricks enough like that for me to be looking out for\\r\\nhim by this time?  But old fools is the biggest\\r\\nfools there is.  Can’t learn an old dog new\\r\\ntricks, as the saying is.  But my goodness, he\\r\\nnever plays them alike, two days, and how is a body\\r\\nto know what’s coming?  He ’pears to\\r\\nknow just how long he can torment me before I get\\r\\nmy dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put\\r\\nme off for a minute or make me laugh, it’s all\\r\\ndown again and I can’t hit him a lick. \\r\\nI ain’t doing my duty by that boy, and that’s\\r\\nthe Lord’s truth, goodness knows.  Spare\\r\\nthe rod and spile the child, as the Good Book says. \\r\\nI’m a laying up sin and suffering for us both,\\r\\nI know.  He’s full of the Old Scratch, but\\r\\nlaws-a-me! he’s my own dead sister’s boy,\\r\\npoor thing, and I ain’t got the heart to lash\\r\\nhim, somehow.  Every time I let him off, my conscience\\r\\ndoes hurt me so, and every time I hit him my old heart\\r\\nmost breaks.  Well-a-well, man that is born of\\r\\nwoman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture\\r\\nsays, and I reckon it’s so.  He’ll\\r\\nplay hookey this evening,  and [ Southwestern for\\r\\n“afternoon”] I’ll just be obleeged\\r\\nto make him work, to-morrow, to punish him.  It’s\\r\\nmighty hard to make him work Saturdays, when all the\\r\\nboys is having holiday, but he hates work more than\\r\\nhe hates anything else, and I’ve got to\\r\\ndo some of my duty by him, or I’ll be the ruination\\r\\nof the child.” Tom did play hookey, and he had a\\r\\nvery good time.  He got back home barely in season\\r\\nto help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day’s\\r\\nwood and split the kindlings before supper ­at\\r\\nleast he was there in time to tell his adventures\\r\\nto Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work. \\r\\nTom’s younger brother (or rather half-brother)\\r\\nSid was already through with his part of the work\\r\\n(picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy, and had\\r\\nno adventurous, troublesome ways. While Tom was eating his supper, and\\r\\nstealing sugar as opportunity offered, Aunt Polly\\r\\nasked him questions that were full of guile, and very\\r\\ndeep ­for she wanted to trap him into damaging\\r\\nrevealments.  Like many other simple-hearted souls,\\r\\nit was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with\\r\\na talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she\\r\\nloved to contemplate her most transparent devices as\\r\\nmarvels of low cunning.  Said she:  “Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn’t\\r\\nit?” “Yes’m.” “Powerful warm, warn’t it?” “Yes’m.” “Didn’t you want to go in a-swimming,\\r\\nTom?” A bit of a scare shot through Tom ­a\\r\\ntouch of uncomfortable suspicion.  He searched\\r\\nAunt Polly’s face, but it told him nothing. \\r\\nSo he said:  “No’m ­well, not very much.” The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom’s\\r\\nshirt, and said:  “But you ain’t too warm\\r\\nnow, though.”  And it flattered her to reflect\\r\\nthat she had discovered that the shirt was dry without\\r\\nanybody knowing that that was what she had in her\\r\\nmind.  But in spite of her, Tom knew where the\\r\\nwind lay, now.  So he forestalled what might be\\r\\nthe next move:  “Some of us pumped on our heads ­mine’s\\r\\ndamp yet.  See?” Aunt Polly was vexed to think she\\r\\nhad overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence,\\r\\nand missed a trick.  Then she had a new inspiration:  “Tom, you didn’t have\\r\\nto undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump\\r\\non your head, did you?  Unbutton your jacket!” The trouble vanished out of Tom’s\\r\\nface.  He opened his jacket.  His shirt collar\\r\\nwas securely sewed. “Bother!  Well, go ’long\\r\\nwith you.  I’d made sure you’d played\\r\\nhookey and been a-swimming.  But I forgive ye,\\r\\nTom.  I reckon you’re a kind of a singed\\r\\ncat, as the saying is ­better’n you\\r\\nlook.  This time.” She was half sorry her sagacity had\\r\\nmiscarried, and half glad that Tom had stumbled into\\r\\nobedient conduct for once. But Sidney said:  “Well, now, if I didn’t\\r\\nthink you sewed his collar with white thread, but\\r\\nit’s black.” “Why, I did sew it with white!  Tom!” But Tom did not wait for the rest.  As he went\\r\\nout at the door he said:  “Siddy, I’ll lick you for that.” In a safe place Tom examined two large\\r\\nneedles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket,\\r\\nand had thread bound about them ­one needle\\r\\ncarried white thread and the other black.  He said:  “She’d never noticed if\\r\\nit hadn’t been for Sid.  Confound it! sometimes\\r\\nshe sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with\\r\\nblack.  I wish to geeminy she’d stick to\\r\\none or t’other ­I can’t keep\\r\\nthe run of ’em.  But I bet you I’ll\\r\\nlam Sid for that.  I’ll learn him!” He was not the Model Boy of the village. \\r\\nHe knew the model boy very well though ­and\\r\\nloathed him. Within two minutes, or even less,\\r\\nhe had forgotten all his troubles.  Not because\\r\\nhis troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to\\r\\nhim than a man’s are to a man, but because a\\r\\nnew and powerful interest bore them down and drove\\r\\nthem out of his mind for the time ­just as\\r\\nmen’s misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement\\r\\nof new enterprises.  This new interest was a valued\\r\\nnovelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from\\r\\na negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. \\r\\nIt consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of\\r\\nliquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to\\r\\nthe roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst\\r\\nof the music ­the reader probably remembers\\r\\nhow to do it, if he has ever been a boy.  Diligence\\r\\nand attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he\\r\\nstrode down the street with his mouth full of harmony\\r\\nand his soul full of gratitude.  He felt much as\\r\\nan astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet ­no\\r\\ndoubt, as far as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure\\r\\nis concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not\\r\\nthe astronomer.

His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment,\\r\\nand then broke into a gentle laugh. “Hang the boy, can’t I\\r\\nnever learn anything?  Ain’t he played me\\r\\ntricks enough like that for me to be looking out for\\r\\nhim by this time?  But old fools is the biggest\\r\\nfools there is.  Can’t learn an old dog new\\r\\ntricks, as the saying is.  But my goodness, he\\r\\nnever plays them alike, two days, and how is a body\\r\\nto know what’s coming?  He ’pears to\\r\\nknow just how long he can torment me before I get\\r\\nmy dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put\\r\\nme off for a minute or make me laugh, it’s all\\r\\ndown again and I can’t hit him a lick. \\r\\nI ain’t doing my duty by that boy, and that’s\\r\\nthe Lord’s truth, goodness knows.  Spare\\r\\nthe rod and spile the child, as the Good Book says. \\r\\nI’m a laying up sin and suffering for us both,\\r\\nI know.  He’s full of the Old Scratch, but\\r\\nlaws-a-me! he’s my own dead sister’s boy,\\r\\npoor thing, and I ain’t got the heart to lash\\r\\nhim, somehow.  Every time I let him off, my conscience\\r\\ndoes hurt me so, and every time I hit him my old heart\\r\\nmost breaks.  Well-a-well, man that is born of\\r\\nwoman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture\\r\\nsays, and I reckon it’s so.  He’ll\\r\\nplay hookey this evening,  and [ Southwestern for\\r\\n“afternoon”] I’ll just be obleeged\\r\\nto make him work, to-morrow, to punish him.  It’s\\r\\nmighty hard to make him work Saturdays, when all the\\r\\nboys is having holiday, but he hates work more than\\r\\nhe hates anything else, and I’ve got to\\r\\ndo some of my duty by him, or I’ll be the ruination\\r\\nof the child.” Tom did play hookey, and he had a\\r\\nvery good time.  He got back home barely in season\\r\\nto help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day’s\\r\\nwood and split the kindlings before supper ­at\\r\\nleast he was there in time to tell his adventures\\r\\nto Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work. \\r\\nTom’s younger brother (or rather half-brother)\\r\\nSid was already through with his part of the work\\r\\n(picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy, and had\\r\\nno adventurous, troublesome ways. While Tom was eating his supper, and\\r\\nstealing sugar as opportunity offered, Aunt Polly\\r\\nasked him questions that were full of guile, and very\\r\\ndeep ­for she wanted to trap him into damaging\\r\\nrevealments.  Like many other simple-hearted souls,\\r\\nit was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with\\r\\na talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she\\r\\nloved to contemplate her most transparent devices as\\r\\nmarvels of low cunning.  Said she:  “Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn’t\\r\\nit?” “Yes’m.” “Powerful warm, warn’t it?” “Yes’m.” “Didn’t you want to go in a-swimming,\\r\\nTom?” A bit of a scare shot through Tom ­a\\r\\ntouch of uncomfortable suspicion.  He searched\\r\\nAunt Polly’s face, but it told him nothing. \\r\\nSo he said:  “No’m ­well, not very much.” The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom’s\\r\\nshirt, and said:  “But you ain’t too warm\\r\\nnow, though.”  And it flattered her to reflect\\r\\nthat she had discovered that the shirt was dry without\\r\\nanybody knowing that that was what she had in her\\r\\nmind.  But in spite of her, Tom knew where the\\r\\nwind lay, now.  So he forestalled what might be\\r\\nthe next move:  “Some of us pumped on our heads ­mine’s\\r\\ndamp yet.  See?” Aunt Polly was vexed to think she\\r\\nhad overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence,\\r\\nand missed a trick.  Then she had a new inspiration:  “Tom, you didn’t have\\r\\nto undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump\\r\\non your head, did you?  Unbutton your jacket!” The trouble vanished out of Tom’s\\r\\nface.  He opened his jacket.  His shirt collar\\r\\nwas securely sewed. “Bother!  Well, go ’long\\r\\nwith you.  I’d made sure you’d played\\r\\nhookey and been a-swimming.  But I forgive ye,\\r\\nTom.  I reckon you’re a kind of a singed\\r\\ncat, as the saying is ­better’n you\\r\\nlook.  This time.” She was half sorry her sagacity had\\r\\nmiscarried, and half glad that Tom had stumbled into\\r\\nobedient conduct for once. But Sidney said:  “Well, now, if I didn’t\\r\\nthink you sewed his collar with white thread, but\\r\\nit’s black.” “Why, I did sew it with white!  Tom!” But Tom did not wait for the rest.  As he went\\r\\nout at the door he said:  “Siddy, I’ll lick you for that.” In a safe place Tom examined two large\\r\\nneedles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket,\\r\\nand had thread bound about them ­one needle\\r\\ncarried white thread and the other black.  He said:  “She’d never noticed if\\r\\nit hadn’t been for Sid.  Confound it! sometimes\\r\\nshe sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with\\r\\nblack.  I wish to geeminy she’d stick to\\r\\none or t’other ­I can’t keep\\r\\nthe run of ’em.  But I bet you I’ll\\r\\nlam Sid for that.  I’ll learn him!” He was not the Model Boy of the village. \\r\\nHe knew the model boy very well though ­and\\r\\nloathed him. Within two minutes, or even less,\\r\\nhe had forgotten all his troubles.  Not because\\r\\nhis troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to\\r\\nhim than a man’s are to a man, but because a\\r\\nnew and powerful interest bore them down and drove\\r\\nthem out of his mind for the time ­just as\\r\\nmen’s misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement\\r\\nof new enterprises.  This new interest was a valued\\r\\nnovelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from\\r\\na negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. \\r\\nIt consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of\\r\\nliquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to\\r\\nthe roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst\\r\\nof the music ­the reader probably remembers\\r\\nhow to do it, if he has ever been a boy.  Diligence\\r\\nand attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he\\r\\nstrode down the street with his mouth full of harmony\\r\\nand his soul full of gratitude.  He felt much as\\r\\nan astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet ­no\\r\\ndoubt, as far as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure\\r\\nis concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not\\r\\nthe astronomer. The summer evenings were long. \\r\\nIt was not dark, yet.  Presently Tom checked his\\r\\nwhistle.  A stranger was before him ­a\\r\\nboy a shade larger than himself.  A new-comer\\r\\nof any age or either sex was an impressive curiosity\\r\\nin the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. \\r\\nThis boy was well dressed, too ­well dressed\\r\\non a week-day.  This was simply astounding. \\r\\nHis cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue\\r\\ncloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his\\r\\npantaloons.  He had shoes on ­and it\\r\\nwas only Friday.  He even wore a necktie, a bright\\r\\nbit of ribbon.  He had a citified air about him\\r\\nthat ate into Tom’s vitals.  The more Tom\\r\\nstared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned\\r\\nup his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier\\r\\nhis own outfit seemed to him to grow.  Neither\\r\\nboy spoke.  If one moved, the other moved ­but\\r\\nonly sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face\\r\\nand eye to eye all the time.  Finally Tom said:  “I can lick you!” “I’d like to see you try it.” “Well, I can do it.” “No you can’t, either.” “Yes I can.” “No you can’t.” “I can.” “You can’t.” “Can!” “Can’t!” An uncomfortable pause.  Then Tom said:  “What’s your name?” “’Tisn’t any of your business, maybe.” “Well I ’low I’ll make it my\\r\\nbusiness.” “Well why don’t you?” “If you say much, I will.” “Much ­much ­much. \\r\\nThere now.” “Oh, you think you’re\\r\\nmighty smart, don’t you?  I could lick\\r\\nyou with one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.” “Well why don’t you do it?  You\\r\\nsay you can do it.” “Well I will, if you fool with me.” “Oh yes ­I’ve seen whole families\\r\\nin the same fix.” “Smarty!  You think you’re some,\\r\\nnow, don’t you?  Oh, what a hat!” “You can lump that hat if you\\r\\ndon’t like it.  I dare you to knock it off ­and\\r\\nanybody that’ll take a dare will suck eggs.” “You’re a liar!” “You’re another.” “You’re a fighting liar and dasn’t\\r\\ntake it up.” “Aw ­take a walk!” “Say ­if you give\\r\\nme much more of your sass I’ll take and bounce\\r\\na rock off’n your head.” “Oh, of course you will.” “Well I will.” “Well why don’t you do\\r\\nit then?  What do you keep saying you will\\r\\nfor?  Why don’t you do it?  It’s\\r\\nbecause you’re afraid.” “I ain’t afraid.” “You are.” “I ain’t.” “You are.” Another pause, and more eying and\\r\\nsidling around each other.  Presently they were\\r\\nshoulder to shoulder.  Tom said:  “Get away from here!” “Go away yourself!” “I won’t.” “I won’t either.” So they stood, each with a foot placed\\r\\nat an angle as a brace, and both shoving with might\\r\\nand main, and glowering at each other with hate. \\r\\nBut neither could get an advantage.  After struggling\\r\\ntill both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain\\r\\nwith watchful caution, and Tom said:  “You’re a coward and a\\r\\npup.  I’ll tell my big brother on you, and\\r\\nhe can thrash you with his little finger, and I’ll\\r\\nmake him do it, too.” “What do I care for your big\\r\\nbrother?  I’ve got a brother that’s\\r\\nbigger than he is ­and what’s more,\\r\\nhe can throw him over that fence, too.” [Both\\r\\nbrothers were imaginary.] “That’s a lie.” “Your saying so don’t make it so.” Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and\\r\\nsaid:  “I dare you to step over that,\\r\\nand I’ll lick you till you can’t stand\\r\\nup.  Anybody that’ll take a dare will steal\\r\\nsheep.” The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:  “Now you said you’d do it, now let’s\\r\\nsee you do it.” “Don’t you crowd me now; you better look\\r\\nout.” “Well, you said you’d do it ­why\\r\\ndon’t you do it?” “By jingo! for two cents I will do it.” The new boy took two broad coppers\\r\\nout of his pocket and held them out with derision. \\r\\nTom struck them to the ground.  In an instant both\\r\\nboys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped\\r\\ntogether like cats; and for the space of a minute\\r\\nthey tugged and tore at each other’s hair and\\r\\nclothes, punched and scratched each other’s nose,\\r\\nand covered themselves with dust and glory.  Presently\\r\\nthe confusion took form, and through the fog of battle\\r\\nTom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding\\r\\nhim with his fists.  “Holler ’nuff!”\\r\\nsaid he. The boy only struggled to free himself.  He was\\r\\ncrying ­mainly from rage. “Holler ’nuff!” ­and the\\r\\npounding went on. At last the stranger got out a smothered\\r\\n“’Nuff!” and Tom let him up and\\r\\nsaid:  “Now that’ll learn you. \\r\\nBetter look out who you’re fooling with next\\r\\ntime.” The new boy went off brushing the\\r\\ndust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally\\r\\nlooking back and shaking his head and threatening\\r\\nwhat he would do to Tom the “next time he caught\\r\\nhim out.”  To which Tom responded with jeers,\\r\\nand started off in high feather, and as soon as his\\r\\nback was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw\\r\\nit and hit him between the shoulders and then turned\\r\\ntail and ran like an antelope.  Tom chased the\\r\\ntraitor home, and thus found out where he lived. \\r\\nHe then held a position at the gate for some time,\\r\\ndaring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only\\r\\nmade faces at him through the window and declined. \\r\\nAt last the enemy’s mother appeared, and called\\r\\nTom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. \\r\\nSo he went away; but he said he “’lowed”\\r\\nto “lay” for that boy. He got home pretty late that night,\\r\\nand when he climbed cautiously in at the window, he\\r\\nuncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt;\\r\\nand when she saw the state his clothes were in her\\r\\nresolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity\\r\\nat hard labor became adamantine in its firmness.\""

       "and had thread bound about them ­one needle\r\n",
       "carried white thread and the other black.  He said:  “She’d never noticed if\r\n",
       "it hadn’t been for Sid.  Confound it! sometimes\r\n",
       "she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with\r\n",
       "black.  I wish to geeminy she’d stick to\r\n",
       "one or t’other ­I can’t keep\r\n",
       "the run of ’em.  But I bet you I’ll\r\n",
       "lam Sid for that.  I’ll learn him!” He was not the Model Boy of the village. \r\n",
       "He knew the model boy very well though ­and\r\n",
       "loathed him. Within two minutes, or even less,\r\n",
       "he had forgotten all his troubles.  Not because\r\n",
       "his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to\r\n",
       "him than a man’s are to a man, but because a\r\n",
       "new and powerful interest bore them down and drove\r\n",
       "them out of his mind for the time ­just as\r\n",
       "men’s misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement\r\n",
       "of new enterprises.  This new interest was a valued\r\n",
       "novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from\r\n",
       "a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. \r\n",
       "It consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of\r\n",
       "liquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to\r\n",
       "the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst\r\n",
       "of the music ­the reader probably remembers\r\n",
       "how to do it, if he has ever been a boy.  Diligence\r\n",
       "and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he\r\n",
       "strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony\r\n",
       "and his soul full of gratitude.  He felt much as\r\n",
       "an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet ­no\r\n",
       "doubt, as far as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure\r\n",
       "is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not\r\n",
       "the astronomer. The summer evenings were long. \r\n",
       "It was not dark, yet.  Presently Tom checked his\r\n",
       "whistle.  A stranger was before him ­a\r\n",
       "boy a shade larger than himself.  A new-comer\r\n",
       "of any age or either sex was an impressive curiosity\r\n",
       "in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. \r\n",
       "This boy was well dressed, too ­well dressed\r\n",
       "on a week-day.  This was simply astounding. \r\n",
       "His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue\r\n",
       "cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his\r\n",
       "pantaloons.  He had shoes on ­and it\r\n",
       "was only Friday.  He even wore a necktie, a bright\r\n",
       "bit of ribbon.  He had a citified air about him\r\n",
       "that ate into Tom’s vitals.  The more Tom\r\n",
       "stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned\r\n",
       "up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier\r\n",
       "his own outfit seemed to him to grow.  Neither\r\n",
       "boy spoke.  If one moved, the other moved ­but\r\n",
       "only sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face\r\n",
       "and eye to eye all the time.  Finally Tom said:  “I can lick you!” “I’d like to see you try it.” “Well, I can do it.” “No you can’t, either.” “Yes I can.” “No you can’t.” “I can.” “You can’t.” “Can!” “Can’t!” An uncomfortable pause.  Then Tom said:  “What’s your name?” “’Tisn’t any of your business, maybe.” “Well I ’low I’ll make it my\r\n",
       "business.” “Well why don’t you?” “If you say much, I will.” “Much ­much ­much. \r\n",
       "There now.” “Oh, you think you’re\r\n",
       "mighty smart, don’t you?  I could lick\r\n",
       "you with one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.” “Well why don’t you do it?  You\r\n",
       "say you can do it.” “Well I will, if you fool with me.” “Oh yes ­I’ve seen whole families\r\n",
       "in the same fix.” “Smarty!  You think you’re some,\r\n",
       "now, don’t you?  Oh, what a hat!” “You can lump that hat if you\r\n",
       "don’t like it.  I dare you to knock it off ­and\r\n",
       "anybody that’ll take a dare will suck eggs.” “You’re a liar!” “You’re another.” “You’re a fighting liar and dasn’t\r\n",
       "take it up.” “Aw ­take a walk!” “Say ­if you give\r\n",
       "me much more of your sass I’ll take and bounce\r\n",
       "a rock off’n your head.” “Oh, of course you will.” “Well I will.” “Well why don’t you do\r\n",
       "it then?  What do you keep saying you will\r\n",
       "for?  Why don’t you do it?  It’s\r\n",
       "because you’re afraid.” “I ain’t afraid.” “You are.” “I ain’t.” “You are.” Another pause, and more eying and\r\n",
       "sidling around each other.  Presently they were\r\n",
       "shoulder to shoulder.  Tom said:  “Get away from here!” “Go away yourself!” “I won’t.” “I won’t either.” So they stood, each with a foot placed\r\n",
       "at an angle as a brace, and both shoving with might\r\n",
       "and main, and glowering at each other with hate. \r\n",
       "But neither could get an advantage.  After struggling\r\n",
       "till both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain\r\n",
       "with watchful caution, and Tom said:  “You’re a coward and a\r\n",
       "pup.  I’ll tell my big brother on you, and\r\n",
       "he can thrash you with his little finger, and I’ll\r\n",
       "make him do it, too.” “What do I care for your big\r\n",
       "brother?  I’ve got a brother that’s\r\n",
       "bigger than he is ­and what’s more,\r\n",
       "he can throw him over that fence, too.” [Both\r\n",
       "brothers were imaginary.] “That’s a lie.” “Your saying so don’t make it so.” Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and\r\n",
       "said:  “I dare you to step over that,\r\n",
       "and I’ll lick you till you can’t stand\r\n",
       "up.  Anybody that’ll take a dare will steal\r\n",
       "sheep.” The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:  “Now you said you’d do it, now let’s\r\n",
       "see you do it.” “Don’t you crowd me now; you better look\r\n",
       "out.” “Well, you said you’d do it ­why\r\n",
       "don’t you do it?” “By jingo! for two cents I will do it.” The new boy took two broad coppers\r\n",
       "out of his pocket and held them out with derision. \r\n",
       "Tom struck them to the ground.  In an instant both\r\n",
       "boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped\r\n",
       "together like cats; and for the space of a minute\r\n",
       "they tugged and tore at each other’s hair and\r\n",
       "clothes, punched and scratched each other’s nose,\r\n",
       "and covered themselves with dust and glory.  Presently\r\n",
       "the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle\r\n",
       "Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding\r\n",
       "him with his fists.  “Holler ’nuff!”\r\n",
       "said he. The boy only struggled to free himself.  He was\r\n",
       "crying ­mainly from rage. “Holler ’nuff!” ­and the\r\n",
       "pounding went on. At last the stranger got out a smothered\r\n",
       "“’Nuff!” and Tom let him up and\r\n",
       "said:  “Now that’ll learn you. \r\n",
       "Better look out who you’re fooling with next\r\n",
       "time.” The new boy went off brushing the\r\n",
       "dust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally\r\n",
       "looking back and shaking his head and threatening\r\n",
       "what he would do to Tom the “next time he caught\r\n",
       "him out.”  To which Tom responded with jeers,\r\n",
       "and started off in high feather, and as soon as his\r\n",
       "back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw\r\n",
       "it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned\r\n",
       "tail and ran like an antelope.  Tom chased the\r\n",
       "traitor home, and thus found out where he lived. \r\n",
       "He then held a position at the gate for some time,\r\n",
       "daring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only\r\n",
       "made faces at him through the window and declined. \r\n",
       "At last the enemy’s mother appeared, and called\r\n",
       "Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. \r\n",
       "So he went away; but he said he “’lowed”\r\n",
       "to “lay” for that boy. He got home pretty late that night,\r\n",
       "and when he climbed cautiously in at the window, he\r\n",
       "uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt;\r\n",
       "and when she saw the state his clothes were in her\r\n",
       "resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity\r\n",
       "at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness.

       "skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and singing\r\n",
       "Buffalo Gals.  Bringing water from the town pump\r\n",
       "had always been hateful work in Tom’s eyes, before,\r\n",
       "but now it did not strike him so.  He remembered\r\n",
       "that there was company at the pump.  White, mulatto,\r\n",
       "and negro boys and girls were always there waiting\r\n",
       "their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling,\r\n",

       "his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe\r\n",
       "with absorbing interest while the bandage was being\r\n",
       "unwound.  In another moment he was flying down\r\n",
       "the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was\r\n",
       "whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring\r\n",
       "from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph\r\n",
       "in her eye. But Tom’s energy did not last. \r\n",
       "He began to think of the fun he had planned for this\r\n",
       "day, and his sorrows multiplied.  Soon the free\r\n",
       "boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious\r\n",
       "expeditions, and they would make a world of fun of\r\n",
       "him for having to work ­the very thought\r\n",
       "of it burnt him like fire.  He got out his worldly\r\n",
       "wealth and examined it ­bits of toys, marbles,\r\n",
       "and trash; enough to buy an exchange of work,\r\n",
       "maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an\r\n",
       "hour of pure freedom.  So he returned his straitened\r\n",
       "means to his pocket, and gave up the idea of trying\r\n",
       "to buy the boys.  At this dark and hopeless moment\r\n",
       "an inspiration burst upon him!  Nothing less than\r\n",
       "a great, magnificent inspiration. He took up his brush and went tranquilly\r\n",
       "to work.  Ben Rogers hove in sight presently ­the\r\n",
       "very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been\r\n",
       "dreading.  Ben’s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump ­proof\r\n",
       "enough that his heart was light and his anticipations\r\n",
       "high.  He was eating an apple, and giving a long,\r\n",
       "melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned\r\n",
       "ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating\r\n",
       "a steamboat.  As he drew near, he slackened speed,\r\n",
       "took the middle of the street, leaned far over to\r\n",
       "starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious\r\n",
       "pomp and circumstance ­for he was personating\r\n",
       "the Big Missouri, and considered himself to be drawing\r\n",
       "nine feet of water.  He was boat and captain and\r\n",
       "engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself\r\n",
       "standing on his own hurricane-deck giving the orders\r\n",
       "and executing them:  “Stop her, sir!  Ting-a-ling-ling!”\r\n",
       "The headway ran almost out, and he drew up slowly\r\n",
       "toward the sidewalk. “Ship up to back!  Ting-a-ling-ling!”\r\n",
       "His arms straightened and stiffened down his sides. “Set her back on the stabboard! \r\n",
       "Ting-a-ling-ling!  Chow! ch-chow-wow! \r\n",
       "Chow!” His right hand, meantime, describing stately\r\n",
       "circles ­for it was representing a forty-foot\r\n",
       "wheel. “Let her go back on the labboard! \r\n",

       "with your spring-line ­what’re you\r\n",

       "SH’T!  S’H’T!  SH’T!”\r\n",
       "(trying the gauge-cocks). Tom went on whitewashing ­paid\r\n",
       "no attention to the steamboat.  Ben stared a moment\r\n",
       "and then said:  “Hi-Yi!  You’re\r\n",
       "up a stump, ain’t you!” No answer.  Tom surveyed his last\r\n",
       "touch with the eye of an artist, then he gave his\r\n",
       "brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result,\r\n",
       "as before.  Ben ranged up alongside of him. \r\n",
       "Tom’s mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck\r\n",
       "to his work.  Ben said:  “Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?” Tom wheeled suddenly and said:  “Why, it’s you, Ben!  I warn’t\r\n",
       "noticing.” “Say ­I’m going\r\n",
       "in a-swimming, I am.  Don’t you wish you\r\n",
       "could?  But of course you’d druther work ­wouldn’t\r\n",
       "you?  Course you would!” Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:  “What do you call work?” “Why, ain’t that work?” Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:  “Well, maybe it is, and maybe\r\n",
       "it ain’t.  All I know, is, it suits Tom\r\n",
       "Sawyer.” “Oh come, now, you don’t mean to let on\r\n",
       "that you like it?” The brush continued to move. “Like it?  Well, I don’t\r\n",
       "see why I oughtn’t to like it.  Does a boy\r\n",
       "get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?” That put the thing in a new light. \r\n",
       "Ben stopped nibbling his apple.  Tom swept his\r\n",
       "brush daintily back and forth ­stepped back\r\n",
       "to note the effect ­added a touch here and\r\n",
       "there ­criticised the effect again ­Ben\r\n",
       "watching every move and getting more and more interested,\r\n",
       "more and more absorbed.  Presently he said:  “Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.” Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered\r\n",
       "his mind:  “No ­no ­I\r\n",
       "reckon it wouldn’t hardly do, Ben.  You see,\r\n",
       "Aunt Polly’s awful particular about this fence ­right\r\n",
       "here on the street, you know  ­but if it\r\n",
       "was the back fence I wouldn’t mind and she\r\n",
       "wouldn’t.  Yes, she’s awful particular\r\n",
       "about this fence; it’s got to be done very careful;\r\n",
       "I reckon there ain’t one boy in a thousand, maybe\r\n",
       "two thousand, that can do it the way it’s got\r\n",
       "to be done.” “No ­is that so? \r\n",
       "Oh come, now ­lemme just try.  Only\r\n",
       "just a little ­I’d let you, if\r\n",
       "you was me, Tom.” “Ben, I’d like to, honest\r\n",
       "injun; but Aunt Polly ­well, Jim wanted to\r\n",
       "do it, but she wouldn’t let him; Sid wanted to\r\n",
       "do it, and she wouldn’t let Sid.  Now don’t\r\n",

       "as careful.  Now lemme try.  Say ­I’ll\r\n",
       "give you the core of my apple.” “Well, here ­No, Ben, now don’t. \r\n",
       "I’m afeard ­” “I’ll give you all of it!” Tom gave up the brush with reluctance\r\n",
       "in his face, but alacrity in his heart.  And while\r\n",
       "the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in\r\n",
       "the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the\r\n",
       "shade close by, dangled his legs, munched his apple,\r\n",
       "and planned the slaughter of more innocents. \r\n",
       "There was no lack of material; boys happened along\r\n",
       "every little while; they came to jeer, but remained\r\n",
       "to whitewash.  By the time Ben was fagged out,\r\n",
       "Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for\r\n",
       "a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny\r\n",
       "Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing\r\n",
       "it with ­and so on, and so on, hour after\r\n",
       "hour.  And when the middle of the afternoon came,\r\n",
       "from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning,\r\n",
       "Tom was literally rolling in wealth.  He had besides\r\n",
       "the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part\r\n",
       "of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look\r\n",
       "through, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn’t\r\n",
       "unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper\r\n",
       "of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles,\r\n",
       "six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass\r\n",
       "doorknob, a dog-collar ­but no dog ­the\r\n",
       "handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel, and\r\n",
       "a dilapidated old window sash. He had had a nice, good, idle time\r\n",
       "all the while ­plenty of company  ­and\r\n",
       "the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! \r\n",
       "If he hadn’t run out of whitewash he would have\r\n",
       "bankrupted every boy in the village. Tom said to himself that it was not\r\n",
       "such a hollow world, after all.  He had discovered\r\n",
       "a great law of human action, without knowing it ­namely,\r\n",
       "that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing,\r\n",
       "it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to\r\n",

       "that Work consists of whatever a body is obliged\r\n",
       "to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is\r\n",
       "not obliged to do.  And this would help him to\r\n",

       "\t<tr><th scope=row>3</th><td>Tom presented himself before\r\n",
       "Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an open window in a\r\n",
       "pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom, breakfast-room,\r\n",
       "dining-room, and library, combined.  The balmy\r\n",
       "summer air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers,\r\n",
       "and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their\r\n",
       "effect, and she was nodding over her knitting  ­for\r\n",
       "she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in\r\n",
       "her lap.  Her spectacles were propped up on her\r\n",
       "gray head for safety.  She had thought that of\r\n",
       "course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered\r\n",
       "at seeing him place himself in her power again in\r\n",
       "this intrepid way.  He said:  “Mayn’t\r\n",
       "I go and play now, aunt?” “What, a’ready?  How much have you\r\n",
       "done?” “It’s all done, aunt.” “Tom, don’t lie to me ­I can’t\r\n",
       "bear it.” “I ain’t, aunt; it is all done.” Aunt Polly placed small trust in such\r\n",
       "evidence.  She went out to see for herself; and\r\n",
       "she would have been content to find twenty per cent.\r\n",
       "of Tom’s statement true.  When she found\r\n",
       "the entire fence whitewashed, and not only whitewashed\r\n",
       "but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a streak\r\n",
       "added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. \r\n",
       "She said:  “Well, I never!  There’s\r\n",
       "no getting round it, you can work when you’re\r\n",
       "a mind to, Tom.”  And then she diluted the\r\n",
       "compliment by adding, “But it’s powerful\r\n",
       "seldom you’re a mind to, I’m bound to say. \r\n",
       "Well, go ’long and play; but mind you get back\r\n",
       "some time in a week, or I’ll tan you.” She was so overcome by the splendor\r\n",
       "of his achievement that she took him into the closet\r\n",
       "and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him,\r\n",
       "along with an improving lecture upon the added value\r\n",
       "and flavor a treat took to itself when it came without\r\n",
       "sin through virtuous effort.  And while she closed\r\n",
       "with a happy Scriptural flourish, he “hooked”\r\n",
       "a doughnut. Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just\r\n",
       "starting up the outside stairway that led to the back\r\n",
       "rooms on the second floor.  Clods were handy and\r\n",
       "the air was full of them in a twinkling.  They\r\n",
       "raged around Sid like a hail-storm; and before Aunt\r\n",
       "Polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally\r\n",
       "to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal\r\n",
       "effect, and Tom was over the fence and gone. \r\n",
       "There was a gate, but as a general thing he was too\r\n",
       "crowded for time to make use of it.  His soul was\r\n",
       "at peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling\r\n",
       "attention to his black thread and getting him into\r\n",
       "trouble. Tom skirted the block, and came round\r\n",
       "into a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunt’s\r\n",
       "cow-stable.  He presently got safely beyond the\r\n",
       "reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward\r\n",
       "the public square of the village, where two “military”\r\n",
       "companies of boys had met for conflict, according\r\n",
       "to previous appointment.  Tom was General of one\r\n",
       "of these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General\r\n",
       "of the other.  These two great commanders did\r\n",
       "not condescend to fight in person ­that being\r\n",
       "better suited to the still smaller fry ­but\r\n",
       "sat together on an eminence and conducted the field\r\n",
       "operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp. \r\n",
       "Tom’s army won a great victory, after a long\r\n",
       "and hard-fought battle.  Then the dead were counted,\r\n",
       "prisoners exchanged, the terms of the next disagreement\r\n",
       "agreed upon, and the day for the necessary battle\r\n",
       "appointed; after which the armies fell into line and\r\n",
       "marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone. As he was passing by the house where\r\n",
       "Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new girl in the garden ­a\r\n",
       "lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow hair\r\n",
       "plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and\r\n",
       "embroidered pantalettes.  The fresh-crowned hero\r\n",
       "fell without firing a shot.  A certain Amy Lawrence\r\n",
       "vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory\r\n",
       "of herself behind.  He had thought he loved her\r\n",
       "to distraction; he had regarded his passion as adoration;\r\n",
       "and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality. \r\n",
       "He had been months winning her; she had confessed\r\n",
       "hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the\r\n",
       "proudest boy in the world only seven short days, and\r\n",
       "here in one instant of time she had gone out of his\r\n",
       "heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done. He worshipped this new angel with\r\n",
       "furtive eye, till he saw that she had discovered him;\r\n",
       "then he pretended he did not know she was present,\r\n",
       "and began to “show off” in all sorts of\r\n",
       "absurd boyish ways, in order to win her admiration. \r\n",
       "He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time;\r\n",
       "but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous\r\n",
       "gymnastic performances, he glanced aside and saw that\r\n",
       "the little girl was wending her way toward the house. \r\n",
       "Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it, grieving,\r\n",
       "and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. \r\n",
       "She halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward\r\n",
       "the door.  Tom heaved a great sigh as she put\r\n",
       "her foot on the threshold.  But his face lit up,\r\n",
       "right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a\r\n",
       "moment before she disappeared. The boy ran around and stopped within\r\n",
       "a foot or two of the flower, and then shaded his eyes\r\n",
       "with his hand and began to look down street as if\r\n",
       "he had discovered something of interest going on in\r\n",
       "that direction.  Presently he picked up a straw\r\n",
       "and began trying to balance it on his nose, with his\r\n",
       "head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to\r\n",
       "side, in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward\r\n",
       "the pansy; finally his bare foot rested upon it, his\r\n",
       "pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped away with\r\n",
       "the treasure and disappeared round the corner. \r\n",
       "But only for a minute ­only while he could\r\n",
       "button the flower inside his jacket, next his heart ­or\r\n",
       "next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted\r\n",
       "in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway. He returned, now, and hung about the\r\n",
       "fence till nightfall, “showing off,” as\r\n",
       "before; but the girl never exhibited herself again,\r\n",
       "though Tom comforted himself a little with the hope\r\n",
       "that she had been near some window, meantime, and\r\n",
       "been aware of his attentions.  Finally he strode\r\n",
       "home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions. All through supper his spirits were\r\n",
       "so high that his aunt wondered “what had got\r\n",
       "into the child.”  He took a good scolding\r\n",
       "about clodding Sid, and did not seem to mind it in\r\n",
       "the least.  He tried to steal sugar under his\r\n",
       "aunt’s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped\r\n",
       "for it.  He said:  “Aunt, you don’t whack Sid when he takes\r\n",
       "it.” “Well, Sid don’t torment\r\n",
       "a body the way you do.  You’d be always into\r\n",
       "that sugar if I warn’t watching you.” Presently she stepped into the kitchen,\r\n",
       "and Sid, happy in his immunity, reached for the sugar-bowl ­a\r\n",
       "sort of glorying over Tom which was wellnigh unbearable. \r\n",
       "But Sid’s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped\r\n",
       "and broke.  Tom was in ecstasies.  In such\r\n",
       "ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was\r\n",
       "silent.  He said to himself that he would not\r\n",
       "speak a word, even when his aunt came in, but would\r\n",
       "sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief;\r\n",
       "and then he would tell, and there would be nothing\r\n",
       "so good in the world as to see that pet model “catch\r\n",
       "it.”  He was so brimful of exultation that\r\n",
       "he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came\r\n",
       "back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings\r\n",
       "of wrath from over her spectacles.  He said to\r\n",
       "himself, “Now it’s coming!” And the\r\n",
       "next instant he was sprawling on the floor!  The\r\n",
       "potent palm was uplifted to strike again when Tom cried\r\n",
       "out:  “Hold on, now, what ’er\r\n",
       "you belting me for? ­Sid broke it!” Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and\r\n",
       "Tom looked for healing pity.  But when she got\r\n",
       "her tongue again, she only said:  “Umf!  Well, you didn’t\r\n",
       "get a lick amiss, I reckon.  You been into some\r\n",
       "other audacious mischief when I wasn’t around,\r\n",
       "like enough.” Then her conscience reproached her,\r\n",
       "and she yearned to say something kind and loving;\r\n",
       "but she judged that this would be construed into a\r\n",
       "confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline\r\n",
       "forbade that.  So she kept silence, and went about\r\n",
       "her affairs with a troubled heart.  Tom sulked\r\n",
       "in a corner and exalted his woes.  He knew that\r\n",
       "in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him, and\r\n",
       "he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of\r\n",
       "it.  He would hang out no signals, he would take\r\n",
       "notice of none.  He knew that a yearning glance\r\n",
       "fell upon him, now and then, through a film of tears,\r\n",
       "but he refused recognition of it.  He pictured\r\n",
       "himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending\r\n",
       "over him beseeching one little forgiving word, but\r\n",
       "he would turn his face to the wall, and die with that\r\n",
       "word unsaid.  Ah, how would she feel then? \r\n",
       "And he pictured himself brought home from the river,\r\n",
       "dead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at\r\n",
       "rest.  How she would throw herself upon him, and\r\n",
       "how her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray\r\n",
       "God to give her back her boy and she would never,\r\n",
       "never abuse him any more!  But he would lie there\r\n",
       "cold and white and make no sign ­a poor little\r\n",
       "sufferer, whose griefs were at an end.  He so\r\n",
       "worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these\r\n",
       "dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like\r\n",
       "to choke; and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which\r\n",
       "overflowed when he winked, and ran down and trickled\r\n",
       "from the end of his nose.  And such a luxury to\r\n",
       "him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could\r\n",
       "not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating\r\n",
       "delight intrude upon it; it was too sacred for such\r\n",
       "contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced\r\n",
       "in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after\r\n",
       "an age-long visit of one week to the country, he got\r\n",
       "up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door\r\n",
       "as she brought song and sunshine in at the other. He wandered far from the accustomed\r\n",
       "haunts of boys, and sought desolate places that were\r\n",
       "in harmony with his spirit.  A log raft in the\r\n",
       "river invited him, and he seated himself on its outer\r\n",
       "edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream,\r\n",
       "wishing, the while, that he could only be drowned,\r\n",
       "all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing\r\n",
       "the uncomfortable routine devised by nature.  Then\r\n",
       "he thought of his flower.  He got it out, rumpled\r\n",
       "and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal felicity. \r\n",
       "He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? \r\n",
       "Would she cry, and wish that she had a right to put\r\n",
       "her arms around his neck and comfort him?  Or\r\n",
       "would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world? \r\n",
       "This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable\r\n",
       "suffering that he worked it over and over again in\r\n",
       "his mind and set it up in new and varied lights, till\r\n",
       "he wore it threadbare.  At last he rose up sighing\r\n",
       "and departed in the darkness. About half-past nine or ten o’clock\r\n",
       "he came along the deserted street to where the Adored\r\n",
       "Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon\r\n",
       "his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow\r\n",
       "upon the curtain of a second-story window.  Was\r\n",
       "the sacred presence there?  He climbed the fence,\r\n",
       "threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till\r\n",
       "he stood under that window; he looked up at it long,\r\n",
       "and with emotion; then he laid him down on the ground\r\n",
       "under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his\r\n",
       "hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor\r\n",
       "wilted flower.  And thus he would die ­out\r\n",
       "in the cold world, with no shelter over his homeless\r\n",
       "head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from\r\n",
       "his brow, no loving face to bend pityingly over him\r\n",
       "when the great agony came.  And thus she would\r\n",
       "see him when she looked out upon the glad morning,\r\n",
       "and oh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor,\r\n",
       "lifeless form, would she heave one little sigh to see\r\n",
       "a bright young life so rudely blighted, so untimely\r\n",
       "cut down? The window went up, a maid-servant’s\r\n",
       "discordant voice profaned the holy calm, and a deluge\r\n",
       "of water drenched the prone martyr’s remains! The strangling hero sprang up with\r\n",
       "a relieving snort.  There was a whiz as of a missile\r\n",
       "in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound\r\n",
       "as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague\r\n",
       "form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom. Not long after, as Tom, all undressed\r\n",
       "for bed, was surveying his drenched garments by the\r\n",
       "light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he had\r\n",
       "any dim idea of making any “references to allusions,”\r\n",
       "he thought better of it and held his peace, for there\r\n",

       "what?  Why don’t you tell me, Mary? ­what\r\n",
       "do you want to be so mean for?” “Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed\r\n",
       "thing, I’m not teasing you.  I wouldn’t\r\n",
       "do that.  You must go and learn it again. \r\n",
       "Don’t you be discouraged, Tom, you’ll\r\n",
       "manage it ­and if you do, I’ll give\r\n",
       "you something ever so nice.  There, now, that’s\r\n",
       "a good boy.” “All right!  What is it, Mary, tell me what\r\n",
       "it is.” “Never you mind, Tom.  You know if I say\r\n",
       "it’s nice, it is nice.” “You bet you that’s so, Mary.  All\r\n",
       "right, I’ll tackle it again.” And he did “tackle it again” ­and\r\n",
       "under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective\r\n",
       "gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished\r\n",
       "a shining success.  Mary gave him a brand-new “Barlow”\r\n",
       "knife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion\r\n",
       "of delight that swept his system shook him to his\r\n",
       "foundations.  True, the knife would not cut anything,\r\n",
       "but it was a “sure-enough” Barlow, and\r\n",
       "there was inconceivable grandeur in that ­though\r\n",
       "where the Western boys ever got the idea that such\r\n",
       "a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury\r\n",
       "is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. \r\n",
       "Tom contrived to scarify the cupboard with it, and\r\n",
       "was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was\r\n",
       "called off to dress for Sunday-school. Mary gave him a tin basin of water\r\n",
       "and a piece of soap, and he went outside the door\r\n",
       "and set the basin on a little bench there; then he\r\n",
       "dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned\r\n",
       "up his sleeves; poured out the water on the ground,\r\n",
       "gently, and then entered the kitchen and began to\r\n",
       "wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. \r\n",
       "But Mary removed the towel and said:  “Now ain’t you ashamed,\r\n",
       "Tom.  You mustn’t be so bad.  Water won’t\r\n",
       "hurt you.” Tom was a trifle disconcerted. \r\n",
       "The basin was refilled, and this time he stood over\r\n",
       "it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a\r\n",
       "big breath and began.  When he entered the kitchen\r\n",
       "presently, with both eyes shut and groping for the\r\n",
       "towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of suds\r\n",
       "and water was dripping from his face.  But when\r\n",
       "he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory,\r\n",
       "for the clean territory stopped short at his chin\r\n",
       "and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line\r\n",
       "there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread\r\n",
       "downward in front and backward around his neck. \r\n",
       "Mary took him in hand, and when she was done with\r\n",
       "him he was a man and a brother, without distinction\r\n",
       "of color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed,\r\n",
       "and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical\r\n",
       "general effect. [He privately smoothed out the curls,\r\n",
       "with labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair\r\n",
       "close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate,\r\n",
       "and his own filled his life with bitterness.] Then\r\n",
       "Mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been\r\n",
       "used only on Sundays during two years ­they\r\n",
       "were simply called his “other clothes” ­and\r\n",
       "so by that we know the size of his wardrobe. \r\n",
       "The girl “put him to rights” after he had\r\n",
       "dressed himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout\r\n",
       "up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar down\r\n",
       "over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him\r\n",
       "with his speckled straw hat.  He now looked exceedingly\r\n",
       "improved and uncomfortable.  He was fully as uncomfortable\r\n",
       "as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole\r\n",
       "clothes and cleanliness that galled him.  He hoped\r\n",
       "that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was\r\n",
       "blighted; she coated them thoroughly with tallow,\r\n",
       "as was the custom, and brought them out.  He lost\r\n",
       "his temper and said he was always being made to do\r\n",
       "everything he didn’t want to do.  But Mary\r\n",
       "said, persuasively:  “Please, Tom ­that’s a good\r\n",
       "boy.” So he got into the shoes snarling. \r\n",
       "Mary was soon ready, and the three children set out\r\n",
       "for Sunday-school ­a place that Tom hated\r\n",
       "with his whole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of\r\n",
       "it. Sabbath-school hours were from nine\r\n",
       "to half-past ten; and then church service.  Two\r\n",
       "of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,\r\n",
       "and the other always remained too ­for stronger\r\n",
       "reasons.  The church’s high-backed, uncushioned\r\n",
       "pews would seat about three hundred persons; the edifice\r\n",
       "was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine\r\n",
       "board tree-box on top of it for a steeple.  At\r\n",
       "the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a Sunday-dressed\r\n",
       "comrade:  “Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?” “Yes.” “What’ll you take for her?” “What’ll you give?” “Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.” “Less see ’em.” Tom exhibited.  They were satisfactory,\r\n",
       "and the property changed hands.  Then Tom traded\r\n",
       "a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and\r\n",
       "some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. \r\n",
       "He waylaid other boys as they came, and went on buying\r\n",
       "tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer. \r\n",
       "He entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean\r\n",
       "and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and\r\n",
       "started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. \r\n",
       "The teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered; then\r\n",
       "turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy’s\r\n",
       "hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book\r\n",
       "when the boy turned around; stuck a pin in another\r\n",
       "boy, presently, in order to hear him say “Ouch!”\r\n",
       "and got a new reprimand from his teacher.  Tom’s\r\n",
       "whole class were of a pattern ­restless,\r\n",
       "noisy, and troublesome.  When they came to recite\r\n",
       "their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly,\r\n",
       "but had to be prompted all along.  However, they\r\n",
       "worried through, and each got his reward ­in\r\n",
       "small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture\r\n",
       "on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of\r\n",
       "the recitation.  Ten blue tickets equalled a red\r\n",
       "one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets\r\n",
       "equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the\r\n",
       "superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth\r\n",
       "forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil. \r\n",
       "How many of my readers would have the industry and\r\n",
       "application to memorize two thousand verses, even\r\n",
       "for a Dore Bible?  And yet Mary had acquired two\r\n",
       "Bibles in this way ­it was the patient work\r\n",
       "of two years ­and a boy of German parentage\r\n",
       "had won four or five.  He once recited three thousand\r\n",
       "verses without stopping; but the strain upon his mental\r\n",
       "faculties was too great, and he was little better\r\n",
       "than an idiot from that day forth ­a grievous\r\n",
       "misfortune for the school, for on great occasions,\r\n",
       "before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed\r\n",
       "it) had always made this boy come out and “spread\r\n",
       "himself.”  Only the older pupils managed\r\n",
       "to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work\r\n",
       "long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of\r\n",
       "one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance;\r\n",
       "the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for\r\n",
       "that day that on the spot every scholar’s heart\r\n",
       "was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted\r\n",
       "a couple of weeks.  It is possible that Tom’s\r\n",
       "mental stomach had never really hungered for one of\r\n",
       "those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being\r\n",
       "had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat\r\n",
       "that came with it. In due course the superintendent stood\r\n",
       "up in front of the pulpit, with a closed hymn-book\r\n",
       "in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its\r\n",
       "leaves, and commanded attention.  When a Sunday-school\r\n",
       "superintendent makes his customary little speech,\r\n",
       "a hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the\r\n",
       "inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer\r\n",
       "who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo\r\n",
       "at a concert  ­though why, is a mystery: \r\n",
       "for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is\r\n",
       "ever referred to by the sufferer.  This superintendent\r\n",
       "was a slim creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee\r\n",
       "and short sandy hair; he wore a stiff standing-collar\r\n",
       "whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose\r\n",
       "sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of\r\n",
       "his mouth ­a fence that compelled a straight\r\n",
       "lookout ahead, and a turning of the whole body when\r\n",
       "a side view was required; his chin was propped on\r\n",
       "a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as\r\n",
       "a bank-note, and had fringed ends; his boot toes were\r\n",
       "turned sharply up, in the fashion of the day, like\r\n",
       "sleigh-runners ­an effect patiently and\r\n",
       "laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with\r\n",
       "their toes pressed against a wall for hours together. \r\n",
       "Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very sincere\r\n",
       "and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and\r\n",
       "places in such reverence, and so separated them from\r\n",
       "worldly matters, that unconsciously to himself his\r\n",
       "Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation\r\n",
       "which was wholly absent on week-days.  He began\r\n",
       "after this fashion:  “Now, children, I want you all\r\n",
       "to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and\r\n",
       "give me all your attention for a minute or two. \r\n",
       "There  ­that is it.  That is the way\r\n",
       "good little boys and girls should do.  I see one\r\n",
       "little girl who is looking out of the window ­I\r\n",
       "am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere ­perhaps\r\n",
       "up in one of the trees making a speech to the little\r\n",
       "birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how\r\n",
       "good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean\r\n",
       "little faces assembled in a place like this, learning\r\n",
       "to do right and be good.”  And so forth\r\n",
       "and so on.  It is not necessary to set down the\r\n",
       "rest of the oration.  It was of a pattern which\r\n",
       "does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all. The latter third of the speech was\r\n",
       "marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations\r\n",
       "among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings and\r\n",
       "whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even\r\n",
       "to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like\r\n",
       "Sid and Mary.  But now every sound ceased suddenly,\r\n",
       "with the subsidence of Mr. Walters’ voice, and\r\n",
       "the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst\r\n",
       "of silent gratitude. A good part of the whispering had\r\n",
       "been occasioned by an event which was more or less\r\n",
       "rare ­the entrance of visitors:  lawyer\r\n",
       "Thatcher, accompanied by a very feeble and aged man;\r\n",
       "a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray\r\n",
       "hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter’s\r\n",
       "wife.  The lady was leading a child.  Tom had\r\n",
       "been restless and full of chafings and repinings;\r\n",
       "conscience-smitten, too ­he could not meet\r\n",
       "Amy Lawrence’s eye, he could not brook her loving\r\n",
       "gaze.  But when he saw this small new-comer his\r\n",
       "soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment.  The\r\n",
       "next moment he was “showing off” with all\r\n",
       "his might  ­cuffing boys, pulling hair,\r\n",
       "making faces ­in a word, using every art\r\n",
       "that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her\r\n",
       "applause.  His exaltation had but one alloy ­the\r\n",
       "memory of his humiliation in this angel’s garden ­and\r\n",
       "that record in sand was fast washing out, under the\r\n",
       "waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now. The visitors were given the highest\r\n",
       "seat of honor, and as soon as Mr. Walters’ speech\r\n",
       "was finished, he introduced them to the school. \r\n",
       "The middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious\r\n",
       "personage ­no less a one than the county\r\n",
       "judge ­altogether the most august creation\r\n",
       "these children had ever looked upon ­and\r\n",
       "they wondered what kind of material he was made of ­and\r\n",
       "they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid\r\n",
       "he might, too.  He was from Constantinople, twelve\r\n",
       "miles away ­so he had travelled, and seen\r\n",
       "the world ­these very eyes had looked upon\r\n",
       "the county court-house ­which was said to\r\n",
       "have a tin roof.  The awe which these reflections\r\n",
       "inspired was attested by the impressive silence and\r\n",
       "the ranks of staring eyes.  This was the great\r\n",
       "Judge Thatcher, brother of their own lawyer. \r\n",
       "Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar\r\n",
       "with the great man and be envied by the school. \r\n",
       "It would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings:  “Look at him, Jim!  He’s\r\n",
       "a going up there.  Say ­look! he’s\r\n",
       "a going to shake hands with him ­he is\r\n",
       "shaking hands with him!  By jings, don’t\r\n",
       "you wish you was Jeff?” Mr. Walters fell to “showing\r\n",
       "off,” with all sorts of official bustlings and\r\n",
       "activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging\r\n",
       "directions here, there, everywhere that he could find\r\n",
       "a target.  The librarian “showed off” ­running\r\n",
       "hither and thither with his arms full of books and\r\n",
       "making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect\r\n",
       "authority delights in.  The young lady teachers\r\n",
       "“showed off”  ­bending sweetly\r\n",
       "over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting\r\n",
       "pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting\r\n",
       "good ones lovingly.  The young gentlemen teachers\r\n",
       "“showed off” with small scoldings and\r\n",
       "other little displays of authority and fine attention\r\n",
       "to discipline ­and most of the teachers,\r\n",
       "of both sexes, found business up at the library, by\r\n",
       "the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had\r\n",
       "to be done over again two or three times (with much\r\n",
       "seeming vexation).  The little girls “showed\r\n",
       "off” in various ways, and the little boys “showed\r\n",
       "off” with such diligence that the air was thick\r\n",
       "with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. \r\n",
       "And above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic\r\n",
       "judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself\r\n",
       "in the sun of his own grandeur ­for he was\r\n",
       "“showing off,” too. There was only one thing wanting to\r\n",
       "make Mr. Walters’ ecstasy complete, and that\r\n",
       "was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a\r\n",
       "prodigy.  Several pupils had a few yellow tickets,\r\n",
       "but none had enough  ­he had been around\r\n",
       "among the star pupils inquiring.  He would have\r\n",
       "given worlds, now, to have that German lad back again\r\n",
       "with a sound mind. And now at this moment, when hope\r\n",
       "was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with nine yellow\r\n",
       "tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and\r\n",
       "demanded a Bible.  This was a thunderbolt out of\r\n",
       "a clear sky.  Walters was not expecting an application\r\n",
       "from this source for the next ten years.  But\r\n",
       "there was no getting around it ­here were\r\n",
       "the certified checks, and they were good for their\r\n",
       "face.  Tom was therefore elevated to a place with\r\n",
       "the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was\r\n",
       "announced from headquarters.  It was the most stunning\r\n",
       "surprise of the decade, and so profound was the sensation\r\n",
       "that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one’s\r\n",
       "altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon\r\n",
       "in place of one.  The boys were all eaten up with\r\n",
       "envy ­but those that suffered the bitterest\r\n",
       "pangs were those who perceived too late that they\r\n",
       "themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by\r\n",
       "trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed\r\n",
       "in selling whitewashing privileges.  These despised\r\n",
       "themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a\r\n",
       "guileful snake in the grass. The prize was delivered to Tom with\r\n",
       "as much effusion as the superintendent could pump\r\n",
       "up under the circumstances; but it lacked somewhat\r\n",
       "of the true gush, for the poor fellow’s instinct\r\n",
       "taught him that there was a mystery here that could\r\n",
       "not well bear the light, perhaps; it was simply preposterous\r\n",
       "that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves\r\n",
       "of Scriptural wisdom on his premises ­a dozen\r\n",
       "would strain his capacity, without a doubt. Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and\r\n",
       "she tried to make Tom see it in her face ­but\r\n",
       "he wouldn’t look.  She wondered; then she\r\n",
       "was just a grain troubled; next a dim suspicion came\r\n",
       "and went ­came again; she watched; a furtive\r\n",
       "glance told her worlds ­and then her heart\r\n",
       "broke, and she was jealous, and angry, and the tears\r\n",
       "came and she hated everybody.  Tom most of all\r\n",
       "(she thought). Tom was introduced to the Judge; but\r\n",
       "his tongue was tied, his breath would hardly come,\r\n",
       "his heart quaked ­partly because of the awful\r\n",
       "greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her\r\n",
       "parent.  He would have liked to fall down and\r\n",
       "worship him, if it were in the dark.  The Judge\r\n",
       "put his hand on Tom’s head and called him a fine\r\n",
       "little man, and asked him what his name was. \r\n",
       "The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:  “Tom.” “Oh, no, not Tom ­it is ­” “Thomas.” “Ah, that’s it.  I\r\n",
       "thought there was more to it, maybe.  That’s\r\n",
       "very well.  But you’ve another one I daresay,\r\n",
       "and you’ll tell it to me, won’t you?” “Tell the gentleman your other\r\n",
       "name, Thomas,” said Walters, “and say\r\n",
       "sir.  You mustn’t forget your manners.” “Thomas Sawyer ­sir.” “That’s it!  That’s\r\n",

       "A good, generous prayer it was, and went into details: \r\n",
       "it pleaded for the church, and the little children\r\n",
       "of the church; for the other churches of the village;\r\n",

       "for poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for the oppressed\r\n",
       "millions groaning under the heel of European monarchies\r\n",
       "and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light\r\n",

       "nor ears to hear withal; for the heathen in the far\r\n",
       "islands of the sea; and closed with a supplication\r\n",
       "that the words he was about to speak might find grace\r\n",
       "and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding\r\n",
       "in time a grateful harvest of good.  Amen. There was a rustling of dresses, and\r\n",
       "the standing congregation sat down.  The boy whose\r\n",
       "history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer,\r\n",
       "he only endured it ­if he even did that much. \r\n",
       "He was restive all through it; he kept tally of the\r\n",
       "details of the prayer, unconsciously  ­for\r\n",
       "he was not listening, but he knew the ground of old,\r\n",
       "and the clergyman’s regular route over it ­and\r\n",
       "when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,\r\n",
       "his ear detected it and his whole nature resented\r\n",
       "it; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. \r\n",
       "In the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back\r\n",
       "of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit\r\n",
       "by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its\r\n",
       "head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously\r\n",
       "that it seemed to almost part company with the body,\r\n",
       "and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view;\r\n",
       "scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing\r\n",
       "them to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going\r\n",
       "through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew\r\n",
       "it was perfectly safe.  As indeed it was; for\r\n",
       "as sorely as Tom’s hands itched to grab for\r\n",
       "it they did not dare ­he believed his soul\r\n",
       "would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing\r\n",
       "while the prayer was going on.  But with the closing\r\n",
       "sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward;\r\n",
       "and the instant the “Amen” was out the\r\n",
       "fly was a prisoner of war.  His aunt detected\r\n",
       "the act and made him let it go. The minister gave out his text and\r\n",
       "droned along monotonously through an argument that\r\n",
       "was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod\r\n",
       " ­and yet it was an argument that dealt in\r\n",
       "limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined\r\n",
       "elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth\r\n",
       "the saving.  Tom counted the pages of the sermon;\r\n",
       "after church he always knew how many pages there had\r\n",
       "been, but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse. \r\n",
       "However, this time he was really interested for a\r\n",
       "little while.  The minister made a grand and moving\r\n",
       "picture of the assembling together of the world’s\r\n",
       "hosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb\r\n",
       "should lie down together and a little child should\r\n",
       "lead them.  But the pathos, the lesson, the moral\r\n",
       "of the great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he\r\n",
       "only thought of the conspicuousness of the principal\r\n",
       "character before the on-looking nations; his face\r\n",
       "lit with the thought, and he said to himself that he\r\n",
       "wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion. Now he lapsed into suffering again,\r\n",
       "as the dry argument was resumed.  Presently he\r\n",
       "bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. \r\n",
       "It was a large black beetle with formidable jaws ­a\r\n",
       "“pinchbug,” he called it.  It was\r\n",
       "in a percussion-cap box.  The first thing the beetle\r\n",
       "did was to take him by the finger.  A natural\r\n",
       "fillip followed, the beetle went floundering into\r\n",
       "the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger\r\n",
       "went into the boy’s mouth.  The beetle lay\r\n",
       "there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over. \r\n",
       "Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out\r\n",
       "of his reach.  Other people uninterested in the\r\n",
       "sermon found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it\r\n",
       "too.  Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling\r\n",
       "along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness\r\n",
       "and the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. \r\n",
       "He spied the beetle; the drooping tail lifted and\r\n",
       "wagged.  He surveyed the prize; walked around\r\n",
       "it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around\r\n",
       "it again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then\r\n",
       "lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just\r\n",
       "missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy\r\n",
       "the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle\r\n",
       "between his paws, and continued his experiments; grew\r\n",
       "weary at last, and then indifferent and absent-minded. \r\n",
       "His head nodded, and little by little his chin descended\r\n",
       "and touched the enemy, who seized it.  There was\r\n",
       "a sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle’s head, and\r\n",
       "the beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit on\r\n",
       "its back once more.  The neighboring spectators\r\n",
       "shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went\r\n",
       "behind fans and handkerchiefs, and Tom was entirely\r\n",
       "happy.  The dog looked foolish, and probably felt\r\n",
       "so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and\r\n",
       "a craving for revenge.  So he went to the beetle\r\n",
       "and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it\r\n",
       "from every point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws\r\n",
       "within an inch of the creature, making even closer\r\n",
       "snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head\r\n",
       "till his ears flapped again.  But he grew tired\r\n",
       "once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with\r\n",
       "a fly but found no relief; followed an ant around,\r\n",
       "with his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied\r\n",
       "of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely,\r\n",
       "and sat down on it.  Then there was a wild yelp\r\n",
       "of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle;\r\n",
       "the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed\r\n",
       "the house in front of the altar; he flew down the\r\n",
       "other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored\r\n",
       "up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress,\r\n",
       "till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in\r\n",
       "its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light. \r\n",
       "At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course,\r\n",
       "and sprang into its master’s lap; he flung it\r\n",
       "out of the window, and the voice of distress quickly\r\n",
       "thinned away and died in the distance. By this time the whole church was\r\n",
       "red-faced and suffocating with suppressed laughter,\r\n",
       "and the sermon had come to a dead standstill. \r\n",
       "The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame\r\n",
       "and halting, all possibility of impressiveness being\r\n",
       "at an end; for even the gravest sentiments were constantly\r\n",
       "being received with a smothered burst of unholy mirth,\r\n",
       "under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor\r\n",
       "parson had said a rarely facetious thing.  It was\r\n",
       "a genuine relief to the whole congregation when the\r\n",
       "ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced. Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful,\r\n",
       "thinking to himself that there was some satisfaction\r\n",
       "about divine service when there was a bit of variety\r\n",
       "in it.  He had but one marring thought; he was\r\n",
       "willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug,\r\n",
       "but he did not think it was upright in him to carry\r\n",
       "it off.

       "the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet\r\n",
       "and held it up for inspection.  But now he did\r\n",
       "not know the necessary symptoms.  However, it\r\n",
       "seemed well worth while to chance it, so he fell to\r\n",
       "groaning with considerable spirit. But Sid slept on unconscious. Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel\r\n",
       "pain in the toe. No result from Sid. Tom was panting with his exertions\r\n",
       "by this time.  He took a rest and then swelled\r\n",
       "himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans. Sid snored on. Tom was aggravated.  He said,\r\n",
       "“Sid, Sid!” and shook him.  This course\r\n",
       "worked well, and Tom began to groan again.  Sid\r\n",
       "yawned, stretched, then brought himself up on his\r\n",
       "elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom. \r\n",
       "Tom went on groaning.  Sid said:  “Tom!  Say, Tom!”\r\n",
       "[No response.] “Here, Tom!  Tom! \r\n",
       "What is the matter, Tom?” And he shook him and\r\n",
       "looked in his face anxiously. Tom moaned out:  “Oh, don’t, Sid.  Don’t joggle\r\n",
       "me.” “Why, what’s the matter, Tom?  I must\r\n",
       "call auntie.” “No ­never mind.  It’ll\r\n",
       "be over by and by, maybe.  Don’t call anybody.” “But I must!  Don’t\r\n",
       "groan so, Tom, it’s awful.  How long you\r\n",
       "been this way?” “Hours.  Ouch!  Oh, don’t stir\r\n",
       "so, Sid, you’ll kill me.” “Tom, why didn’t you wake\r\n",
       "me sooner?  Oh, Tom, don’t!  It\r\n",
       "makes my flesh crawl to hear you.  Tom, what is\r\n",
       "the matter?” “I forgive you everything, Sid.\r\n",
       "[Groan.] Everything you’ve ever done to me. \r\n",
       "When I’m gone ­” “Oh, Tom, you ain’t dying,\r\n",
       "are you?  Don’t, Tom ­oh, don’t. \r\n",
       "Maybe ­” “I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.]\r\n",
       "Tell ’em so, Sid.  And Sid, you give my\r\n",
       "window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl\r\n",
       "that’s come to town, and tell her ­” But Sid had snatched his clothes and\r\n",
       "gone.  Tom was suffering in reality, now, so handsomely\r\n",
       "was his imagination working, and so his groans had\r\n",
       "gathered quite a genuine tone. Sid flew down-stairs and said:  “Oh, Aunt Polly, come!  Tom’s dying!” “Dying!” “Yes’m.  Don’t wait ­come\r\n",
       "quick!” “Rubbage!  I don’t believe it!” But she fled up-stairs, nevertheless,\r\n",
       "with Sid and Mary at her heels.  And her face\r\n",
       "grew white, too, and her lip trembled.  When she\r\n",
       "reached the bedside she gasped out:  “You, Tom!  Tom, what’s the matter\r\n",
       "with you?” “Oh, auntie, I’m ­” “What’s the matter with you ­what\r\n",
       "is the matter with you, child?” “Oh, auntie, my sore toe’s mortified!” The old lady sank down into a chair\r\n",
       "and laughed a little, then cried a little, then did\r\n",
       "both together.  This restored her and she said:  “Tom, what a turn you did give\r\n",
       "me.  Now you shut up that nonsense and climb out\r\n",
       "of this.” The groans ceased and the pain vanished\r\n",
       "from the toe.  The boy felt a little foolish,\r\n",
       "and he said:  “Aunt Polly, it seemed\r\n",
       "mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my tooth\r\n",
       "at all.” “Your tooth, indeed!  What’s the matter\r\n",
       "with your tooth?” “One of them’s loose, and it aches perfectly\r\n",
       "awful.” “There, there, now, don’t\r\n",
       "begin that groaning again.  Open your mouth. \r\n",
       "Well ­your tooth is loose, but you’re\r\n",
       "not going to die about that.  Mary, get me a silk\r\n",
       "thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.” Tom said:  “Oh, please, auntie, don’t\r\n",
       "pull it out.  It don’t hurt any more. \r\n",
       "I wish I may never stir if it does.  Please don’t,\r\n",
       "auntie.  I don’t want to stay home from\r\n",
       "school.” “Oh, you don’t, don’t\r\n",
       "you?  So all this row was because you thought\r\n",
       "you’d get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? \r\n",
       "Tom, Tom, I love you so, and you seem to try every\r\n",
       "way you can to break my old heart with your outrageousness.” \r\n",
       "By this time the dental instruments were ready. \r\n",
       "The old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to\r\n",
       "Tom’s tooth with a loop and tied the other to\r\n",
       "the bedpost.  Then she seized the chunk of fire\r\n",
       "and suddenly thrust it almost into the boy’s\r\n",
       "face.  The tooth hung dangling by the bedpost,\r\n",
       "now. But all trials bring their compensations. \r\n",
       "As Tom wended to school after breakfast, he was the\r\n",
       "envy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper\r\n",
       "row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and\r\n",
       "admirable way.  He gathered quite a following of\r\n",
       "lads interested in the exhibition; and one that had\r\n",
       "cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination\r\n",
       "and homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly\r\n",
       "without an adherent, and shorn of his glory.  His\r\n",
       "heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain which\r\n",
       "he did not feel that it wasn’t anything to spit\r\n",
       "like Tom Sawyer; but another boy said, “Sour\r\n",
       "grapes!” and he wandered away a dismantled hero. Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile\r\n",
       "pariah of the village, Huckleberry Finn, son of the\r\n",
       "town drunkard.  Huckleberry was cordially hated\r\n",
       "and dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because\r\n",
       "he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad ­and\r\n",
       "because all their children admired him so, and delighted\r\n",
       "in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to\r\n",
       "be like him.  Tom was like the rest of the respectable\r\n",
       "boys, in that he envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast\r\n",
       "condition, and was under strict orders not to play\r\n",
       "with him.  So he played with him every time he\r\n",
       "got a chance.  Huckleberry was always dressed\r\n",
       "in the cast-off clothes of full-grown men, and they\r\n",
       "were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. \r\n",
       "His hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped\r\n",
       "out of its brim; his coat, when he wore one, hung\r\n",
       "nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far\r\n",
       "down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers;\r\n",
       "the seat of the trousers bagged low and contained\r\n",
       "nothing, the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when\r\n",
       "not rolled up. Huckleberry came and went, at his\r\n",
       "own free will.  He slept on doorsteps in fine\r\n",
       "weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have\r\n",
       "to go to school or to church, or call any being master\r\n",
       "or obey anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when\r\n",
       "and where he chose, and stay as long as it suited\r\n",
       "him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as\r\n",
       "late as he pleased; he was always the first boy that\r\n",
       "went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume\r\n",
       "leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put\r\n",
       "on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. \r\n",
       "In a word, everything that goes to make life precious\r\n",
       "that boy had.  So thought every harassed, hampered,\r\n",
       "respectable boy in St. Petersburg. Tom hailed the romantic outcast:  “Hello, Huckleberry!” “Hello yourself, and see how you like it.” “What’s that you got?” “Dead cat.” “Lemme see him, Huck.  My, he’s pretty\r\n",
       "stiff.  Where’d you get him?” “Bought him off’n a boy.” “What did you give?” “I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got\r\n",
       "at the slaughter-house.” “Where’d you get the blue ticket?” “Bought it off’n Ben Rogers two weeks\r\n",
       "ago for a hoop-stick.” “Say ­what is dead cats good for,\r\n",
       "Huck?” “Good for?  Cure warts with.” “No!  Is that so?  I know something\r\n",
       "that’s better.” “I bet you don’t.  What is it?” “Why, spunk-water.” “Spunk-water!  I wouldn’t give a dern\r\n",
       "for spunk-water.” “You wouldn’t, wouldn’t you? \r\n",
       "D’you ever try it?” “No, I hain’t.  But Bob Tanner did.” “Who told you so!” “Why, he told Jeff Thatcher,\r\n",
       "and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny told Jim Hollis,\r\n",
       "and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and\r\n",
       "the nigger told me.  There now!” “Well, what of it?  They’ll\r\n",
       "all lie.  Leastways all but the nigger.  I\r\n",
       "don’t know him.  But I never see a nigger\r\n",
       "that wouldn’t lie.  Shucks!  Now\r\n",
       "you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.” “Why, he took and dipped his\r\n",
       "hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water was.” “In the daytime?” “Certainly.” “With his face to the stump?” “Yes.  Least I reckon so.” “Did he say anything?” “I don’t reckon he did.  I don’t\r\n",
       "know.” “Aha!  Talk about trying\r\n",
       "to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool way\r\n",
       "as that!  Why, that ain’t a-going to do any\r\n",
       "good.  You got to go all by yourself, to the middle\r\n",
       "of the woods, where you know there’s a spunk-water\r\n",
       "stump, and just as it’s midnight you back up\r\n",
       "against the stump and jam your hand in and say:    ’Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal\r\n",
       "shorts,\r\n",
       "   Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller\r\n",
       "these warts,’ and then walk away quick, eleven steps,\r\n",
       "with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times\r\n",
       "and walk home without speaking to anybody.  Because\r\n",
       "if you speak the charm’s busted.” “Well, that sounds like a good\r\n",
       "way; but that ain’t the way Bob Tanner done.” “No, sir, you can bet he didn’t,\r\n",
       "becuz he’s the wartiest boy in this town; and\r\n",
       "he wouldn’t have a wart on him if he’d\r\n",
       "knowed how to work spunk-water.  I’ve took\r\n",
       "off thousands of warts off of my hands that way, Huck. \r\n",
       "I play with frogs so much that I’ve always got\r\n",
       "considerable many warts.  Sometimes I take ’em\r\n",
       "off with a bean.” “Yes, bean’s good.  I’ve done\r\n",
       "that.” “Have you?  What’s your way?” “You take and split the bean,\r\n",
       "and cut the wart so as to get some blood, and then\r\n",
       "you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take\r\n",
       "and dig a hole and bury it ’bout midnight at\r\n",
       "the crossroads in the dark of the moon, and then you\r\n",
       "burn up the rest of the bean.  You see that piece\r\n",
       "that’s got the blood on it will keep drawing\r\n",
       "and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it,\r\n",
       "and so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and\r\n",
       "pretty soon off she comes.” “Yes, that’s it, Huck ­that’s\r\n",
       "it; though when you’re burying it if you say\r\n",
       "‘Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother\r\n",
       "me!’ it’s better.  That’s the\r\n",
       "way Joe Harper does, and he’s been nearly to\r\n",
       "Coonville and most everywheres.  But say ­how\r\n",
       "do you cure ’em with dead cats?” “Why, you take your cat and\r\n",
       "go and get in the graveyard ’long about midnight\r\n",
       "when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and\r\n",
       "when it’s midnight a devil will come, or maybe\r\n",
       "two or three, but you can’t see ’em, you\r\n",
       "can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear\r\n",
       "’em talk; and when they’re taking that\r\n",
       "feller away, you heave your cat after ’em and\r\n",
       "say, ’Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil,\r\n",
       "warts follow cat, I’m done with ye!’ That’ll\r\n",
       "fetch any wart.” “Sounds right.  D’you ever try it,\r\n",
       "Huck?” “No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.” “Well, I reckon it’s so, then.  Becuz\r\n",
       "they say she’s a witch.” “Say!  Why, Tom, I know\r\n",
       "she is.  She witched pap.  Pap says so his\r\n",
       "own self.  He come along one day, and he see she\r\n",
       "was a-witching him, so he took up a rock, and if she\r\n",
       "hadn’t dodged, he’d a got her.  Well,\r\n",
       "that very night he rolled off’n a shed wher’\r\n",
       "he was a layin drunk, and broke his arm.” “Why, that’s awful.  How did he know\r\n",
       "she was a-witching him?” “Lord, pap can tell, easy. \r\n",
       "Pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy,\r\n",
       "they’re a-witching you.  Specially if they\r\n",
       "mumble.  Becuz when they mumble they’re\r\n",
       "saying the Lord’s Prayer backards.” “Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?” “To-night.  I reckon they’ll come\r\n",
       "after old Hoss Williams to-night.” “But they buried him Saturday.  Didn’t\r\n",
       "they get him Saturday night?” “Why, how you talk!  How\r\n",
       "could their charms work till midnight? ­and\r\n",
       "then it’s Sunday.  Devils don’t\r\n",
       "slosh around much of a Sunday, I don’t reckon.” “I never thought of that.  That’s\r\n",
       "so.  Lemme go with you?” “Of course ­if you ain’t afeard.” “Afeard!  ’Tain’t likely. \r\n",
       "Will you meow?” “Yes ­and you meow\r\n",
       "back, if you get a chance.  Last time, you kep’\r\n",
       "me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing\r\n",
       "rocks at me and says ‘Dern that cat!’\r\n",
       "and so I hove a brick through his window ­but\r\n",
       "don’t you tell.” “I won’t.  I couldn’t\r\n",
       "meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but\r\n",
       "I’ll meow this time.  Say ­what’s\r\n",
       "that?” “Nothing but a tick.” “Where’d you get him?” “Out in the woods.” “What’ll you take for him?” “I don’t know.  I don’t want\r\n",
       "to sell him.” “All right.  It’s a mighty small tick,\r\n",
       "anyway.” “Oh, anybody can run a tick\r\n",
       "down that don’t belong to them.  I’m\r\n",
       "satisfied with it.  It’s a good enough tick\r\n",
       "for me.” “Sho, there’s ticks a\r\n",
       "plenty.  I could have a thousand of ’em if\r\n",
       "I wanted to.” “Well, why don’t you? \r\n",
       "Becuz you know mighty well you can’t.  This\r\n",
       "is a pretty early tick, I reckon.  It’s\r\n",
       "the first one I’ve seen this year.” “Say, Huck ­I’ll give you my\r\n",
       "tooth for him.” “Less see it.” Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully\r\n",
       "unrolled it.  Huckleberry viewed it wistfully. \r\n",
       "The temptation was very strong.  At last he said:  “Is it genuwyne?” Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy. “Well, all right,” said Huckleberry, “it’s\r\n",
       "a trade.” Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap\r\n",
       "box that had lately been the pinchbug’s prison,\r\n",
       "and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than\r\n",
       "before. When Tom reached the little isolated\r\n",
       "frame schoolhouse, he strode in briskly, with the\r\n",
       "manner of one who had come with all honest speed. \r\n",
       "He hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his\r\n",
       "seat with business-like alacrity.  The master,\r\n",
       "throned on high in his great splint-bottom arm-chair,\r\n",
       "was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. \r\n",
       "The interruption roused him. “Thomas Sawyer!” Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full,\r\n",
       "it meant trouble. “Sir!” “Come up here.  Now, sir, why are you late\r\n",
       "again, as usual?” Tom was about to take refuge in a\r\n",
       "lie, when he saw two long tails of yellow hair hanging\r\n",
       "down a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy\r\n",
       "of love; and by that form was the only vacant\r\n",
       "place on the girls’ side of the schoolhouse. \r\n",
       "He instantly said:  “I stopped to talk with\r\n",
       "Huckleberry Finn!” The master’s pulse stood still,\r\n",
       "and he stared helplessly.  The buzz of study ceased. \r\n",
       "The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost\r\n",
       "his mind.  The master said:  “You ­you did what?” “Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.” There was no mistaking the words. “Thomas Sawyer, this is the\r\n",
       "most astounding confession I have ever listened to. \r\n",
       "No mere ferule will answer for this offence.  Take\r\n",
       "off your jacket.” The master’s arm performed until\r\n",
       "it was tired and the stock of switches notably diminished. \r\n",
       "Then the order followed:  “Now, sir, go and sit with the girls!  And\r\n",
       "let this be a warning to you.” The titter that rippled around the\r\n",
       "room appeared to abash the boy, but in reality that\r\n",
       "result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe\r\n",
       "of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay\r\n",
       "in his high good fortune.  He sat down upon the\r\n",
       "end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself\r\n",
       "away from him with a toss of her head.  Nudges\r\n",
       "and winks and whispers traversed the room, but Tom\r\n",
       "sat still, with his arms upon the long, low desk before\r\n",
       "him, and seemed to study his book. By and by attention ceased from him,\r\n",
       "and the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull\r\n",
       "air once more.  Presently the boy began to steal\r\n",
       "furtive glances at the girl.  She observed it,\r\n",
       "“made a mouth” at him and gave him the\r\n",
       "back of her head for the space of a minute.  When\r\n",
       "she cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before\r\n",
       "her.  She thrust it away.  Tom gently put\r\n",
       "it back.  She thrust it away again, but with less\r\n",
       "animosity.  Tom patiently returned it to its place. \r\n",
       "Then she let it remain.  Tom scrawled on his slate,\r\n",
       "“Please take it ­I got more.” \r\n",
       "The girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. \r\n",
       "Now the boy began to draw something on the slate,\r\n",
       "hiding his work with his left hand.  For a time\r\n",
       "the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity\r\n",
       "presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible\r\n",
       "signs.  The boy worked on, apparently unconscious. \r\n",
       "The girl made a sort of noncommittal attempt to see,\r\n",
       "but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. \r\n",
       "At last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered:  “Let me see it.” Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature\r\n",
       "of a house with two gable ends to it and a corkscrew\r\n",
       "of smoke issuing from the chimney.  Then the girl’s\r\n",
       "interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she\r\n",
       "forgot everything else.  When it was finished,\r\n",
       "she gazed a moment, then whispered:  “It’s nice ­make a man.” The artist erected a man in the front\r\n",
       "yard, that resembled a derrick.  He could have\r\n",
       "stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;\r\n",
       "she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:  “It’s a beautiful man ­now make\r\n",
       "me coming along.” Tom drew an hour-glass with a full\r\n",
       "moon and straw limbs to it and armed the spreading\r\n",
       "fingers with a portentous fan.  The girl said:  “It’s ever so nice ­I wish I\r\n",
       "could draw.” “It’s easy,” whispered Tom, “I’ll\r\n",
       "learn you.” “Oh, will you?  When?” “At noon.  Do you go home to dinner?” “I’ll stay if you will.” “Good ­that’s a whack. \r\n",
       "What’s your name?” “Becky Thatcher.  What’s yours? \r\n",
       "Oh, I know.  It’s Thomas Sawyer.” “That’s the name they\r\n",
       "lick me by.  I’m Tom when I’m good. \r\n",
       "You call me Tom, will you?” “Yes.” Now Tom began to scrawl something\r\n",
       "on the slate, hiding the words from the girl. \r\n",
       "But she was not backward this time.  She begged\r\n",
       "to see.  Tom said:  “Oh, it ain’t anything.” “Yes it is.” “No it ain’t.  You don’t want\r\n",
       "to see.” “Yes I do, indeed I do.  Please let me.” “You’ll tell.” “No I won’t ­deed and deed and\r\n",
       "double deed won’t.” “You won’t tell anybody at all?  Ever,\r\n",
       "as long as you live?” “No, I won’t ever tell ANYbody.  Now\r\n",
       "let me.” “Oh, you don’t want to see!” “Now that you treat me so, I\r\n",
       "will see.”  And she put her small hand\r\n",
       "upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending\r\n",
       "to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by\r\n",
       "degrees till these words were revealed:  “I\r\n",
       "love you.” “Oh, you bad thing!” And\r\n",
       "she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and looked\r\n",
       "pleased, nevertheless. Just at this juncture the boy felt\r\n",
       "a slow, fateful grip closing on his ear, and a steady\r\n",
       "lifting impulse.  In that wise he was borne across\r\n",
       "the house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering\r\n",
       "fire of giggles from the whole school.  Then the\r\n",
       "master stood over him during a few awful moments,\r\n",
       "and finally moved away to his throne without saying\r\n",
       "a word.  But although Tom’s ear tingled,\r\n",
       "his heart was jubilant. As the school quieted down Tom made\r\n",
       "an honest effort to study, but the turmoil within\r\n",
       "him was too great.  In turn he took his place in\r\n",
       "the reading class and made a botch of it; then in\r\n",
       "the geography class and turned lakes into mountains,\r\n",
       "mountains into rivers, and rivers into continents,\r\n",
       "till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class,\r\n",
       "and got “turned down,” by a succession\r\n",
       "of mere baby words, till he brought up at the foot\r\n",
       "and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with\r\n",

       "she was bending down and punching under the bed with\r\n",
       "the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the\r\n",

       "cat. “I never did see the beat of that boy!” She went to the open door and stood\r\n",
       "in it and looked out among the tomato vines and “jimpson”\r\n",
       "weeds that constituted the garden.  No Tom. \r\n",
       "So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for\r\n",
       "distance and shouted:  “Y-o-u-u Tom!” There was a slight noise behind her\r\n",
       "and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by\r\n",
       "the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight. “There!  I might ‘a’\r\n",

       "was desperate ­ “My!  Look behind you, aunt!” The old lady whirled round, and snatched\r\n",
       "her skirts out of danger.  The lad fled on the\r\n",
       "instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and disappeared\r\n",
       "over it. His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment,\r\n",

       "do some of my duty by him, or I’ll be the ruination\r\n",
       "of the child.” Tom did play hookey, and he had a\r\n",
       "very good time.  He got back home barely in season\r\n",
       "to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day’s\r\n",
       "wood and split the kindlings before supper ­at\r\n",
       "least he was there in time to tell his adventures\r\n",

       "Tom’s younger brother (or rather half-brother)\r\n",
       "Sid was already through with his part of the work\r\n",
       "(picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy, and had\r\n",
       "no adventurous, troublesome ways. While Tom was eating his supper, and\r\n",
       "stealing sugar as opportunity offered, Aunt Polly\r\n",
       "asked him questions that were full of guile, and very\r\n",
       "deep ­for she wanted to trap him into damaging\r\n",
       "revealments.  Like many other simple-hearted souls,\r\n",
       "it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with\r\n",
       "a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she\r\n",
       "loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as\r\n",
       "marvels of low cunning.  Said she:  “Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn’t\r\n",
       "it?” “Yes’m.” “Powerful warm, warn’t it?” “Yes’m.” “Didn’t you want to go in a-swimming,\r\n",
       "Tom?” A bit of a scare shot through Tom ­a\r\n",
       "touch of uncomfortable suspicion.  He searched\r\n",
       "Aunt Polly’s face, but it told him nothing. \r\n",
       "So he said:  “No’m ­well, not very much.” The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom’s\r\n",
       "shirt, and said:  “But you ain’t too warm\r\n",
       "now, though.”  And it flattered her to reflect\r\n",
       "that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without\r\n",
       "anybody knowing that that was what she had in her\r\n",
       "mind.  But in spite of her, Tom knew where the\r\n",
       "wind lay, now.  So he forestalled what might be\r\n",
       "the next move:  “Some of us pumped on our heads ­mine’s\r\n",
       "damp yet.  See?” Aunt Polly was vexed to think she\r\n",
       "had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence,\r\n",
       "and missed a trick.  Then she had a new inspiration:  “Tom, you didn’t have\r\n",
       "to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump\r\n",
       "on your head, did you?  Unbutton your jacket!” The trouble vanished out of Tom’s\r\n",
       "face.  He opened his jacket.  His shirt collar\r\n",
       "was securely sewed. “Bother!  Well, go ’long\r\n",
       "with you.  I’d made sure you’d played\r\n",
       "hookey and been a-swimming.  But I forgive ye,\r\n",
       "Tom.  I reckon you’re a kind of a singed\r\n",
       "cat, as the saying is ­better’n you\r\n",
       "look.  This time.” She was half sorry her sagacity had\r\n",
       "miscarried, and half glad that Tom had stumbled into\r\n",
       "obedient conduct for once. But Sidney said:  “Well, now, if I didn’t\r\n",
       "think you sewed his collar with white thread, but\r\n",
       "it’s black.” “Why, I did sew it with white!  Tom!” But Tom did not wait for the rest.  As he went\r\n",
       "out at the door he said:  “Siddy, I’ll lick you for that.” In a safe place Tom examined two large\r\n",
       "needles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket,\r\n",
       "and had thread bound about them ­one needle\r\n",
       "carried white thread and the other black.  He said:  “She’d never noticed if\r\n",
       "it hadn’t been for Sid.  Confound it! sometimes\r\n",
       "she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with\r\n",
       "black.  I wish to geeminy she’d stick to\r\n",
       "one or t’other ­I can’t keep\r\n",
       "the run of ’em.  But I bet you I’ll\r\n",
       "lam Sid for that.  I’ll learn him!” He was not the Model Boy of the village. \r\n",
       "He knew the model boy very well though ­and\r\n",
       "loathed him. Within two minutes, or even less,\r\n",
       "he had forgotten all his troubles.  Not because\r\n",
       "his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to\r\n",
       "him than a man’s are to a man, but because a\r\n",
       "new and powerful interest bore them down and drove\r\n",
       "them out of his mind for the time ­just as\r\n",
       "men’s misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement\r\n",
       "of new enterprises.  This new interest was a valued\r\n",
       "novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from\r\n",
       "a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. \r\n",
       "It consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of\r\n",
       "liquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to\r\n",
       "the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst\r\n",
       "of the music ­the reader probably remembers\r\n",
       "how to do it, if he has ever been a boy.  Diligence\r\n",
       "and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he\r\n",
       "strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony\r\n",
       "and his soul full of gratitude.  He felt much as\r\n",
       "an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet ­no\r\n",
       "doubt, as far as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure\r\n",
       "is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not\r\n",
       "the astronomer. The summer evenings were long. \r\n",
       "It was not dark, yet.  Presently Tom checked his\r\n",
       "whistle.  A stranger was before him ­a\r\n",
       "boy a shade larger than himself.  A new-comer\r\n",
       "of any age or either sex was an impressive curiosity\r\n",
       "in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. \r\n",
       "This boy was well dressed, too ­well dressed\r\n",
       "on a week-day.  This was simply astounding. \r\n",
       "His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue\r\n",
       "cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his\r\n",
       "pantaloons.  He had shoes on ­and it\r\n",
       "was only Friday.  He even wore a necktie, a bright\r\n",
       "bit of ribbon.  He had a citified air about him\r\n",
       "that ate into Tom’s vitals.  The more Tom\r\n",
       "stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned\r\n",
       "up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier\r\n",
       "his own outfit seemed to him to grow.  Neither\r\n",
       "boy spoke.  If one moved, the other moved ­but\r\n",
       "only sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face\r\n",
       "and eye to eye all the time.  Finally Tom said:  “I can lick you!” “I’d like to see you try it.” “Well, I can do it.” “No you can’t, either.” “Yes I can.” “No you can’t.” “I can.” “You can’t.” “Can!” “Can’t!” An uncomfortable pause.  Then Tom said:  “What’s your name?” “’Tisn’t any of your business, maybe.” “Well I ’low I’ll make it my\r\n",
       "business.” “Well why don’t you?” “If you say much, I will.” “Much ­much ­much. \r\n",
       "There now.” “Oh, you think you’re\r\n",
       "mighty smart, don’t you?  I could lick\r\n",
       "you with one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.” “Well why don’t you do it?  You\r\n",
       "say you can do it.” “Well I will, if you fool with me.” “Oh yes ­I’ve seen whole families\r\n",
       "in the same fix.” “Smarty!  You think you’re some,\r\n",
       "now, don’t you?  Oh, what a hat!” “You can lump that hat if you\r\n",
       "don’t like it.  I dare you to knock it off ­and\r\n",
       "anybody that’ll take a dare will suck eggs.” “You’re a liar!” “You’re another.” “You’re a fighting liar and dasn’t\r\n",
       "take it up.” “Aw ­take a walk!” “Say ­if you give\r\n",
       "me much more of your sass I’ll take and bounce\r\n",
       "a rock off’n your head.” “Oh, of course you will.” “Well I will.” “Well why don’t you do\r\n",
       "it then?  What do you keep saying you will\r\n",
       "for?  Why don’t you do it?  It’s\r\n",
       "because you’re afraid.” “I ain’t afraid.” “You are.” “I ain’t.” “You are.” Another pause, and more eying and\r\n",
       "sidling around each other.  Presently they were\r\n",
       "shoulder to shoulder.  Tom said:  “Get away from here!” “Go away yourself!” “I won’t.” “I won’t either.” So they stood, each with a foot placed\r\n",
       "at an angle as a brace, and both shoving with might\r\n",
       "and main, and glowering at each other with hate. \r\n",
       "But neither could get an advantage.  After struggling\r\n",
       "till both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain\r\n",
       "with watchful caution, and Tom said:  “You’re a coward and a\r\n",
       "pup.  I’ll tell my big brother on you, and\r\n",
       "he can thrash you with his little finger, and I’ll\r\n",
       "make him do it, too.” “What do I care for your big\r\n",
       "brother?  I’ve got a brother that’s\r\n",
       "bigger than he is ­and what’s more,\r\n",
       "he can throw him over that fence, too.” {[}Both\r\n",
       "brothers were imaginary.{]} “That’s a lie.” “Your saying so don’t make it so.” Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and\r\n",
       "said:  “I dare you to step over that,\r\n",
       "and I’ll lick you till you can’t stand\r\n",
       "up.  Anybody that’ll take a dare will steal\r\n",
       "sheep.” The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:  “Now you said you’d do it, now let’s\r\n",
       "see you do it.” “Don’t you crowd me now; you better look\r\n",
       "out.” “Well, you said you’d do it ­why\r\n",
       "don’t you do it?” “By jingo! for two cents I will do it.” The new boy took two broad coppers\r\n",
       "out of his pocket and held them out with derision. \r\n",
       "Tom struck them to the ground.  In an instant both\r\n",
       "boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped\r\n",
       "together like cats; and for the space of a minute\r\n",
       "they tugged and tore at each other’s hair and\r\n",
       "clothes, punched and scratched each other’s nose,\r\n",
       "and covered themselves with dust and glory.  Presently\r\n",
       "the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle\r\n",
       "Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding\r\n",
       "him with his fists.  “Holler ’nuff!”\r\n",
       "said he. The boy only struggled to free himself.  He was\r\n",
       "crying ­mainly from rage. “Holler ’nuff!” ­and the\r\n",
       "pounding went on. At last the stranger got out a smothered\r\n",
       "“’Nuff!” and Tom let him up and\r\n",
       "said:  “Now that’ll learn you. \r\n",
       "Better look out who you’re fooling with next\r\n",
       "time.” The new boy went off brushing the\r\n",
       "dust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally\r\n",
       "looking back and shaking his head and threatening\r\n",
       "what he would do to Tom the “next time he caught\r\n",
       "him out.”  To which Tom responded with jeers,\r\n",
       "and started off in high feather, and as soon as his\r\n",
       "back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw\r\n",
       "it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned\r\n",
       "tail and ran like an antelope.  Tom chased the\r\n",
       "traitor home, and thus found out where he lived. \r\n",
       "He then held a position at the gate for some time,\r\n",
       "daring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only\r\n",
       "made faces at him through the window and declined. \r\n",
       "At last the enemy’s mother appeared, and called\r\n",
       "Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. \r\n",
       "So he went away; but he said he “’lowed”\r\n",
       "to “lay” for that boy. He got home pretty late that night,\r\n",
       "and when he climbed cautiously in at the window, he\r\n",
       "uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt;\r\n",

       "and trash; enough to buy an exchange of work,\r\n",
       "maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an\r\n",
       "hour of pure freedom.  So he returned his straitened\r\n",

       "to buy the boys.  At this dark and hopeless moment\r\n",
       "an inspiration burst upon him!  Nothing less than\r\n",

       "considerable money; but if they were offered wages\r\n",

       "here in one instant of time she had gone out of his\r\n",

       "gymnastic performances, he glanced aside and saw that\r\n",
       "the little girl was wending her way toward the house. \r\n",
       "Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it, grieving,\r\n",

       "the door.  Tom heaved a great sigh as she put\r\n",
       "her foot on the threshold.  But his face lit up,\r\n",
       "right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a\r\n",
       "moment before she disappeared. The boy ran around and stopped within\r\n",
       "a foot or two of the flower, and then shaded his eyes\r\n",
       "with his hand and began to look down street as if\r\n",
       "he had discovered something of interest going on in\r\n",
       "that direction.  Presently he picked up a straw\r\n",
       "and began trying to balance it on his nose, with his\r\n",
       "head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to\r\n",
       "side, in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward\r\n",
       "the pansy; finally his bare foot rested upon it, his\r\n",
       "pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped away with\r\n",
       "the treasure and disappeared round the corner. \r\n",
       "But only for a minute ­only while he could\r\n",
       "button the flower inside his jacket, next his heart ­or\r\n",
       "next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted\r\n",
       "in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway. He returned, now, and hung about the\r\n",
       "fence till nightfall, “showing off,” as\r\n",
       "before; but the girl never exhibited herself again,\r\n",
       "though Tom comforted himself a little with the hope\r\n",
       "that she had been near some window, meantime, and\r\n",
       "been aware of his attentions.  Finally he strode\r\n",
       "home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions. All through supper his spirits were\r\n",
       "so high that his aunt wondered “what had got\r\n",
       "into the child.”  He took a good scolding\r\n",
       "about clodding Sid, and did not seem to mind it in\r\n",
       "the least.  He tried to steal sugar under his\r\n",
       "aunt’s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped\r\n",
       "for it.  He said:  “Aunt, you don’t whack Sid when he takes\r\n",
       "it.” “Well, Sid don’t torment\r\n",
       "a body the way you do.  You’d be always into\r\n",
       "that sugar if I warn’t watching you.” Presently she stepped into the kitchen,\r\n",
       "and Sid, happy in his immunity, reached for the sugar-bowl ­a\r\n",
       "sort of glorying over Tom which was wellnigh unbearable. \r\n",
       "But Sid’s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped\r\n",
       "and broke.  Tom was in ecstasies.  In such\r\n",
       "ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was\r\n",
       "silent.  He said to himself that he would not\r\n",
       "speak a word, even when his aunt came in, but would\r\n",
       "sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief;\r\n",
       "and then he would tell, and there would be nothing\r\n",
       "so good in the world as to see that pet model “catch\r\n",
       "it.”  He was so brimful of exultation that\r\n",
       "he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came\r\n",
       "back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings\r\n",
       "of wrath from over her spectacles.  He said to\r\n",
       "himself, “Now it’s coming!” And the\r\n",
       "next instant he was sprawling on the floor!  The\r\n",
       "potent palm was uplifted to strike again when Tom cried\r\n",
       "out:  “Hold on, now, what ’er\r\n",
       "you belting me for? ­Sid broke it!” Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and\r\n",
       "Tom looked for healing pity.  But when she got\r\n",
       "her tongue again, she only said:  “Umf!  Well, you didn’t\r\n",
       "get a lick amiss, I reckon.  You been into some\r\n",
       "other audacious mischief when I wasn’t around,\r\n",
       "like enough.” Then her conscience reproached her,\r\n",
       "and she yearned to say something kind and loving;\r\n",
       "but she judged that this would be construed into a\r\n",
       "confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline\r\n",
       "forbade that.  So she kept silence, and went about\r\n",
       "her affairs with a troubled heart.  Tom sulked\r\n",
       "in a corner and exalted his woes.  He knew that\r\n",
       "in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him, and\r\n",
       "he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of\r\n",
       "it.  He would hang out no signals, he would take\r\n",
       "notice of none.  He knew that a yearning glance\r\n",
       "fell upon him, now and then, through a film of tears,\r\n",
       "but he refused recognition of it.  He pictured\r\n",
       "himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending\r\n",
       "over him beseeching one little forgiving word, but\r\n",
       "he would turn his face to the wall, and die with that\r\n",
       "word unsaid.  Ah, how would she feel then? \r\n",
       "And he pictured himself brought home from the river,\r\n",
       "dead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at\r\n",
       "rest.  How she would throw herself upon him, and\r\n",
       "how her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray\r\n",
       "God to give her back her boy and she would never,\r\n",
       "never abuse him any more!  But he would lie there\r\n",
       "cold and white and make no sign ­a poor little\r\n",
       "sufferer, whose griefs were at an end.  He so\r\n",
       "worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these\r\n",
       "dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like\r\n",
       "to choke; and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which\r\n",
       "overflowed when he winked, and ran down and trickled\r\n",
       "from the end of his nose.  And such a luxury to\r\n",
       "him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could\r\n",
       "not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating\r\n",
       "delight intrude upon it; it was too sacred for such\r\n",
       "contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced\r\n",
       "in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after\r\n",
       "an age-long visit of one week to the country, he got\r\n",
       "up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door\r\n",
       "as she brought song and sunshine in at the other. He wandered far from the accustomed\r\n",
       "haunts of boys, and sought desolate places that were\r\n",
       "in harmony with his spirit.  A log raft in the\r\n",
       "river invited him, and he seated himself on its outer\r\n",
       "edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream,\r\n",
       "wishing, the while, that he could only be drowned,\r\n",
       "all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing\r\n",
       "the uncomfortable routine devised by nature.  Then\r\n",
       "he thought of his flower.  He got it out, rumpled\r\n",
       "and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal felicity. \r\n",
       "He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? \r\n",
       "Would she cry, and wish that she had a right to put\r\n",
       "her arms around his neck and comfort him?  Or\r\n",
       "would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world? \r\n",
       "This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable\r\n",
       "suffering that he worked it over and over again in\r\n",
       "his mind and set it up in new and varied lights, till\r\n",
       "he wore it threadbare.  At last he rose up sighing\r\n",
       "and departed in the darkness. About half-past nine or ten o’clock\r\n",
       "he came along the deserted street to where the Adored\r\n",
       "Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon\r\n",
       "his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow\r\n",
       "upon the curtain of a second-story window.  Was\r\n",
       "the sacred presence there?  He climbed the fence,\r\n",
       "threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till\r\n",
       "he stood under that window; he looked up at it long,\r\n",
       "and with emotion; then he laid him down on the ground\r\n",
       "under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his\r\n",
       "hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor\r\n",
       "wilted flower.  And thus he would die ­out\r\n",
       "in the cold world, with no shelter over his homeless\r\n",
       "head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from\r\n",
       "his brow, no loving face to bend pityingly over him\r\n",
       "when the great agony came.  And thus she would\r\n",
       "see him when she looked out upon the glad morning,\r\n",
       "and oh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor,\r\n",
       "lifeless form, would she heave one little sigh to see\r\n",
       "a bright young life so rudely blighted, so untimely\r\n",
       "cut down? The window went up, a maid-servant’s\r\n",
       "discordant voice profaned the holy calm, and a deluge\r\n",
       "of water drenched the prone martyr’s remains! The strangling hero sprang up with\r\n",
       "a relieving snort.  There was a whiz as of a missile\r\n",
       "in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound\r\n",
       "as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague\r\n",
       "form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom. Not long after, as Tom, all undressed\r\n",
       "for bed, was surveying his drenched garments by the\r\n",
       "light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he had\r\n",
       "any dim idea of making any “references to allusions,”\r\n",
       "he thought better of it and held his peace, for there\r\n",
       "was danger in Tom’s eye. Tom turned in without the added vexation\r\n",
       "of prayers, and Sid made mental note of the omission.

       "world, and beamed down upon the peaceful village like\r\n",
       "a benediction.  Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had\r\n",
       "family worship:  it began with a prayer built\r\n",
       "from the ground up of solid courses of Scriptural\r\n",
       "quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of\r\n",
       "originality; and from the summit of this she delivered\r\n",
       "a grim chapter of the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai. Then Tom girded up his loins, so to\r\n",
       "speak, and went to work to “get his verses.” \r\n",
       "Sid had learned his lesson days before.  Tom bent\r\n",
       "all his energies to the memorizing of five verses,\r\n",
       "and he chose part of the Sermon on the Mount, because\r\n",
       "he could find no verses that were shorter.  At\r\n",
       "the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea\r\n",
       "of his lesson, but no more, for his mind was traversing\r\n",
       "the whole field of human thought, and his hands were\r\n",
       "busy with distracting recreations.  Mary took\r\n",
       "his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his\r\n",
       "way through the fog:  “Blessed are the ­a ­a ­” “Poor” ­ “Yes ­poor; blessed are the poor ­a ­a ­” “In spirit ­” “In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit,\r\n",

       "it is.” “Never you mind, Tom.  You know if I say\r\n",
       "it’s nice, it is nice.” “You bet you that’s so, Mary.  All\r\n",
       "right, I’ll tackle it again.” And he did “tackle it again” ­and\r\n",
       "under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective\r\n",
       "gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished\r\n",
       "a shining success.  Mary gave him a brand-new “Barlow”\r\n",
       "knife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion\r\n",
       "of delight that swept his system shook him to his\r\n",
       "foundations.  True, the knife would not cut anything,\r\n",
       "but it was a “sure-enough” Barlow, and\r\n",
       "there was inconceivable grandeur in that ­though\r\n",
       "where the Western boys ever got the idea that such\r\n",
       "a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury\r\n",
       "is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. \r\n",
       "Tom contrived to scarify the cupboard with it, and\r\n",
       "was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was\r\n",
       "called off to dress for Sunday-school. Mary gave him a tin basin of water\r\n",
       "and a piece of soap, and he went outside the door\r\n",
       "and set the basin on a little bench there; then he\r\n",
       "dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned\r\n",
       "up his sleeves; poured out the water on the ground,\r\n",
       "gently, and then entered the kitchen and began to\r\n",
       "wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. \r\n",
       "But Mary removed the towel and said:  “Now ain’t you ashamed,\r\n",
       "Tom.  You mustn’t be so bad.  Water won’t\r\n",
       "hurt you.” Tom was a trifle disconcerted. \r\n",
       "The basin was refilled, and this time he stood over\r\n",
       "it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a\r\n",
       "big breath and began.  When he entered the kitchen\r\n",
       "presently, with both eyes shut and groping for the\r\n",
       "towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of suds\r\n",
       "and water was dripping from his face.  But when\r\n",
       "he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory,\r\n",
       "for the clean territory stopped short at his chin\r\n",
       "and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line\r\n",
       "there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread\r\n",
       "downward in front and backward around his neck. \r\n",
       "Mary took him in hand, and when she was done with\r\n",
       "him he was a man and a brother, without distinction\r\n",
       "of color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed,\r\n",
       "and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical\r\n",
       "general effect. {[}He privately smoothed out the curls,\r\n",
       "with labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair\r\n",
       "close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate,\r\n",
       "and his own filled his life with bitterness.{]} Then\r\n",
       "Mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been\r\n",
       "used only on Sundays during two years ­they\r\n",
       "were simply called his “other clothes” ­and\r\n",
       "so by that we know the size of his wardrobe. \r\n",
       "The girl “put him to rights” after he had\r\n",
       "dressed himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout\r\n",
       "up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar down\r\n",
       "over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him\r\n",
       "with his speckled straw hat.  He now looked exceedingly\r\n",
       "improved and uncomfortable.  He was fully as uncomfortable\r\n",
       "as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole\r\n",
       "clothes and cleanliness that galled him.  He hoped\r\n",
       "that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was\r\n",
       "blighted; she coated them thoroughly with tallow,\r\n",
       "as was the custom, and brought them out.  He lost\r\n",
       "his temper and said he was always being made to do\r\n",
       "everything he didn’t want to do.  But Mary\r\n",
       "said, persuasively:  “Please, Tom ­that’s a good\r\n",
       "boy.” So he got into the shoes snarling. \r\n",
       "Mary was soon ready, and the three children set out\r\n",
       "for Sunday-school ­a place that Tom hated\r\n",
       "with his whole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of\r\n",
       "it. Sabbath-school hours were from nine\r\n",
       "to half-past ten; and then church service.  Two\r\n",
       "of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,\r\n",
       "and the other always remained too ­for stronger\r\n",
       "reasons.  The church’s high-backed, uncushioned\r\n",
       "pews would seat about three hundred persons; the edifice\r\n",
       "was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine\r\n",
       "board tree-box on top of it for a steeple.  At\r\n",
       "the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a Sunday-dressed\r\n",
       "comrade:  “Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?” “Yes.” “What’ll you take for her?” “What’ll you give?” “Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.” “Less see ’em.” Tom exhibited.  They were satisfactory,\r\n",
       "and the property changed hands.  Then Tom traded\r\n",
       "a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and\r\n",
       "some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. \r\n",
       "He waylaid other boys as they came, and went on buying\r\n",
       "tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer. \r\n",
       "He entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean\r\n",
       "and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and\r\n",
       "started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. \r\n",
       "The teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered; then\r\n",
       "turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy’s\r\n",
       "hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book\r\n",
       "when the boy turned around; stuck a pin in another\r\n",
       "boy, presently, in order to hear him say “Ouch!”\r\n",
       "and got a new reprimand from his teacher.  Tom’s\r\n",
       "whole class were of a pattern ­restless,\r\n",
       "noisy, and troublesome.  When they came to recite\r\n",
       "their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly,\r\n",
       "but had to be prompted all along.  However, they\r\n",
       "worried through, and each got his reward ­in\r\n",
       "small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture\r\n",
       "on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of\r\n",
       "the recitation.  Ten blue tickets equalled a red\r\n",
       "one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets\r\n",
       "equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the\r\n",
       "superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth\r\n",
       "forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil. \r\n",
       "How many of my readers would have the industry and\r\n",
       "application to memorize two thousand verses, even\r\n",
       "for a Dore Bible?  And yet Mary had acquired two\r\n",
       "Bibles in this way ­it was the patient work\r\n",
       "of two years ­and a boy of German parentage\r\n",
       "had won four or five.  He once recited three thousand\r\n",
       "verses without stopping; but the strain upon his mental\r\n",
       "faculties was too great, and he was little better\r\n",
       "than an idiot from that day forth ­a grievous\r\n",
       "misfortune for the school, for on great occasions,\r\n",
       "before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed\r\n",
       "it) had always made this boy come out and “spread\r\n",
       "himself.”  Only the older pupils managed\r\n",
       "to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work\r\n",
       "long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of\r\n",
       "one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance;\r\n",
       "the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for\r\n",
       "that day that on the spot every scholar’s heart\r\n",
       "was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted\r\n",
       "a couple of weeks.  It is possible that Tom’s\r\n",
       "mental stomach had never really hungered for one of\r\n",
       "those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being\r\n",
       "had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat\r\n",
       "that came with it. In due course the superintendent stood\r\n",
       "up in front of the pulpit, with a closed hymn-book\r\n",
       "in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its\r\n",
       "leaves, and commanded attention.  When a Sunday-school\r\n",
       "superintendent makes his customary little speech,\r\n",
       "a hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the\r\n",
       "inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer\r\n",
       "who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo\r\n",
       "at a concert  ­though why, is a mystery: \r\n",
       "for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is\r\n",
       "ever referred to by the sufferer.  This superintendent\r\n",
       "was a slim creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee\r\n",
       "and short sandy hair; he wore a stiff standing-collar\r\n",
       "whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose\r\n",
       "sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of\r\n",
       "his mouth ­a fence that compelled a straight\r\n",
       "lookout ahead, and a turning of the whole body when\r\n",
       "a side view was required; his chin was propped on\r\n",
       "a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as\r\n",
       "a bank-note, and had fringed ends; his boot toes were\r\n",
       "turned sharply up, in the fashion of the day, like\r\n",
       "sleigh-runners ­an effect patiently and\r\n",
       "laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with\r\n",
       "their toes pressed against a wall for hours together. \r\n",
       "Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very sincere\r\n",
       "and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and\r\n",
       "places in such reverence, and so separated them from\r\n",
       "worldly matters, that unconsciously to himself his\r\n",
       "Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation\r\n",
       "which was wholly absent on week-days.  He began\r\n",
       "after this fashion:  “Now, children, I want you all\r\n",
       "to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and\r\n",
       "give me all your attention for a minute or two. \r\n",
       "There  ­that is it.  That is the way\r\n",
       "good little boys and girls should do.  I see one\r\n",
       "little girl who is looking out of the window ­I\r\n",
       "am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere ­perhaps\r\n",
       "up in one of the trees making a speech to the little\r\n",
       "birds. {[}Applausive titter.{]} I want to tell you how\r\n",
       "good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean\r\n",
       "little faces assembled in a place like this, learning\r\n",
       "to do right and be good.”  And so forth\r\n",
       "and so on.  It is not necessary to set down the\r\n",
       "rest of the oration.  It was of a pattern which\r\n",
       "does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all. The latter third of the speech was\r\n",
       "marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations\r\n",
       "among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings and\r\n",
       "whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even\r\n",
       "to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like\r\n",
       "Sid and Mary.  But now every sound ceased suddenly,\r\n",
       "with the subsidence of Mr. Walters’ voice, and\r\n",
       "the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst\r\n",
       "of silent gratitude. A good part of the whispering had\r\n",
       "been occasioned by an event which was more or less\r\n",
       "rare ­the entrance of visitors:  lawyer\r\n",
       "Thatcher, accompanied by a very feeble and aged man;\r\n",
       "a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray\r\n",
       "hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter’s\r\n",
       "wife.  The lady was leading a child.  Tom had\r\n",
       "been restless and full of chafings and repinings;\r\n",
       "conscience-smitten, too ­he could not meet\r\n",
       "Amy Lawrence’s eye, he could not brook her loving\r\n",
       "gaze.  But when he saw this small new-comer his\r\n",
       "soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment.  The\r\n",
       "next moment he was “showing off” with all\r\n",
       "his might  ­cuffing boys, pulling hair,\r\n",
       "making faces ­in a word, using every art\r\n",
       "that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her\r\n",
       "applause.  His exaltation had but one alloy ­the\r\n",
       "memory of his humiliation in this angel’s garden ­and\r\n",
       "that record in sand was fast washing out, under the\r\n",
       "waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now. The visitors were given the highest\r\n",
       "seat of honor, and as soon as Mr. Walters’ speech\r\n",
       "was finished, he introduced them to the school. \r\n",
       "The middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious\r\n",
       "personage ­no less a one than the county\r\n",
       "judge ­altogether the most august creation\r\n",
       "these children had ever looked upon ­and\r\n",
       "they wondered what kind of material he was made of ­and\r\n",
       "they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid\r\n",
       "he might, too.  He was from Constantinople, twelve\r\n",
       "miles away ­so he had travelled, and seen\r\n",
       "the world ­these very eyes had looked upon\r\n",
       "the county court-house ­which was said to\r\n",
       "have a tin roof.  The awe which these reflections\r\n",
       "inspired was attested by the impressive silence and\r\n",
       "the ranks of staring eyes.  This was the great\r\n",
       "Judge Thatcher, brother of their own lawyer. \r\n",
       "Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar\r\n",
       "with the great man and be envied by the school. \r\n",
       "It would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings:  “Look at him, Jim!  He’s\r\n",
       "a going up there.  Say ­look! he’s\r\n",
       "a going to shake hands with him ­he is\r\n",
       "shaking hands with him!  By jings, don’t\r\n",
       "you wish you was Jeff?” Mr. Walters fell to “showing\r\n",
       "off,” with all sorts of official bustlings and\r\n",
       "activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging\r\n",
       "directions here, there, everywhere that he could find\r\n",
       "a target.  The librarian “showed off” ­running\r\n",
       "hither and thither with his arms full of books and\r\n",
       "making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect\r\n",
       "authority delights in.  The young lady teachers\r\n",
       "“showed off”  ­bending sweetly\r\n",
       "over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting\r\n",
       "pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting\r\n",
       "good ones lovingly.  The young gentlemen teachers\r\n",
       "“showed off” with small scoldings and\r\n",
       "other little displays of authority and fine attention\r\n",
       "to discipline ­and most of the teachers,\r\n",
       "of both sexes, found business up at the library, by\r\n",
       "the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had\r\n",
       "to be done over again two or three times (with much\r\n",
       "seeming vexation).  The little girls “showed\r\n",
       "off” in various ways, and the little boys “showed\r\n",
       "off” with such diligence that the air was thick\r\n",
       "with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. \r\n",
       "And above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic\r\n",
       "judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself\r\n",
       "in the sun of his own grandeur ­for he was\r\n",
       "“showing off,” too. There was only one thing wanting to\r\n",
       "make Mr. Walters’ ecstasy complete, and that\r\n",
       "was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a\r\n",
       "prodigy.  Several pupils had a few yellow tickets,\r\n",
       "but none had enough  ­he had been around\r\n",
       "among the star pupils inquiring.  He would have\r\n",
       "given worlds, now, to have that German lad back again\r\n",
       "with a sound mind. And now at this moment, when hope\r\n",
       "was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with nine yellow\r\n",
       "tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and\r\n",
       "demanded a Bible.  This was a thunderbolt out of\r\n",
       "a clear sky.  Walters was not expecting an application\r\n",
       "from this source for the next ten years.  But\r\n",
       "there was no getting around it ­here were\r\n",
       "the certified checks, and they were good for their\r\n",
       "face.  Tom was therefore elevated to a place with\r\n",
       "the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was\r\n",
       "announced from headquarters.  It was the most stunning\r\n",
       "surprise of the decade, and so profound was the sensation\r\n",
       "that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one’s\r\n",
       "altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon\r\n",
       "in place of one.  The boys were all eaten up with\r\n",
       "envy ­but those that suffered the bitterest\r\n",
       "pangs were those who perceived too late that they\r\n",
       "themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by\r\n",
       "trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed\r\n",
       "in selling whitewashing privileges.  These despised\r\n",
       "themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a\r\n",
       "guileful snake in the grass. The prize was delivered to Tom with\r\n",
       "as much effusion as the superintendent could pump\r\n",
       "up under the circumstances; but it lacked somewhat\r\n",
       "of the true gush, for the poor fellow’s instinct\r\n",
       "taught him that there was a mystery here that could\r\n",
       "not well bear the light, perhaps; it was simply preposterous\r\n",
       "that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves\r\n",
       "of Scriptural wisdom on his premises ­a dozen\r\n",
       "would strain his capacity, without a doubt. Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and\r\n",
       "she tried to make Tom see it in her face ­but\r\n",
       "he wouldn’t look.  She wondered; then she\r\n",
       "was just a grain troubled; next a dim suspicion came\r\n",
       "and went ­came again; she watched; a furtive\r\n",
       "glance told her worlds ­and then her heart\r\n",
       "broke, and she was jealous, and angry, and the tears\r\n",
       "came and she hated everybody.  Tom most of all\r\n",
       "(she thought). Tom was introduced to the Judge; but\r\n",
       "his tongue was tied, his breath would hardly come,\r\n",
       "his heart quaked ­partly because of the awful\r\n",
       "greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her\r\n",
       "parent.  He would have liked to fall down and\r\n",
       "worship him, if it were in the dark.  The Judge\r\n",
       "put his hand on Tom’s head and called him a fine\r\n",
       "little man, and asked him what his name was. \r\n",
       "The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:  “Tom.” “Oh, no, not Tom ­it is ­” “Thomas.” “Ah, that’s it.  I\r\n",
       "thought there was more to it, maybe.  That’s\r\n",
       "very well.  But you’ve another one I daresay,\r\n",
       "and you’ll tell it to me, won’t you?” “Tell the gentleman your other\r\n",
       "name, Thomas,” said Walters, “and say\r\n",
       "sir.  You mustn’t forget your manners.” “Thomas Sawyer ­sir.” “That’s it!  That’s\r\n",
       "a good boy.  Fine boy.  Fine, manly little\r\n",
       "fellow.  Two thousand verses is a great many ­very,\r\n",
       "very great many.  And you never can be sorry for\r\n",
       "the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge\r\n",
       "is worth more than anything there is in the world;\r\n",
       "it’s what makes great men and good men; you’ll\r\n",
       "be a great man and a good man yourself, some day,\r\n",
       "Thomas, and then you’ll look back and say, It’s\r\n",
       "all owing to the precious Sunday-school privileges\r\n",
       "of my boyhood ­it’s all owing to my\r\n",
       "dear teachers that taught me to learn ­it’s\r\n",
       "all owing to the good superintendent, who encouraged\r\n",
       "me, and watched over me, and gave me a beautiful Bible ­a\r\n",
       "splendid elegant Bible ­to keep and have\r\n",
       "it all for my own, always ­it’s all\r\n",
       "owing to right bringing up!  That is what you\r\n",
       "will say, Thomas ­and you wouldn’t\r\n",
       "take any money for those two thousand verses ­no\r\n",
       "indeed you wouldn’t.  And now you wouldn’t\r\n",
       "mind telling me and this lady some of the things you’ve\r\n",
       "learned ­no, I know you wouldn’t ­for\r\n",
       "we are proud of little boys that learn.  Now, no\r\n",
       "doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples. \r\n",
       "Won’t you tell us the names of the first two\r\n",
       "that were appointed?” Tom was tugging at a button-hole and\r\n",
       "looking sheepish.  He blushed, now, and his eyes\r\n",
       "fell.  Mr. Walters’ heart sank within him. \r\n",
       "He said to himself, it is not possible that the boy\r\n",
       "can answer the simplest question ­why did\r\n",
       "the Judge ask him?  Yet he felt obliged to speak\r\n",
       "up and say:  “Answer the gentleman, Thomas ­don’t\r\n",
       "be afraid.” Tom still hung fire. “Now I know you’ll tell\r\n",
       "me,” said the lady.  “The names of\r\n",
       "the first two disciples were ­” “David and GOLIAH!” Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of\r\n",
       "the scene.\\\\\n",
       "\t5 & About half-past ten the cracked\r\n",
       "bell of the small church began to ring, and presently\r\n",
       "the people began to gather for the morning sermon. \r\n",
       "The Sunday-school children distributed themselves about\r\n",
       "the house and occupied pews with their parents, so\r\n",
       "as to be under supervision.  Aunt Polly came,\r\n",
       "and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her ­Tom\r\n",
       "being placed next the aisle, in order that he might\r\n",
       "be as far away from the open window and the seductive\r\n",
       "outside summer scenes as possible.  The crowd\r\n",
       "filed up the aisles:  the aged and needy postmaster,\r\n",
       "who had seen better days; the mayor and his wife ­for\r\n",
       "they had a mayor there, among other unnecessaries;\r\n",
       "the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair,\r\n",
       "smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and\r\n",
       "well-to-do, her hill mansion the only palace in the\r\n",
       "town, and the most hospitable and much the most lavish\r\n",
       "in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could\r\n",
       "boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward;\r\n",
       "lawyer Riverson, the new notable from a distance;\r\n",
       "next the belle of the village, followed by a troop\r\n",
       "of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers;\r\n",
       "then all the young clerks in town in a body ­for\r\n",
       "they had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane-heads,\r\n",
       "a circling wall of oiled and simpering admirers, till\r\n",
       "the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all\r\n",
       "came the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful\r\n",
       "care of his mother as if she were cut glass.  He\r\n",
       "always brought his mother to church, and was the pride\r\n",
       "of all the matrons.  The boys all hated him, he\r\n",
       "was so good.  And besides, he had been “thrown\r\n",
       "up to them” so much.  His white handkerchief\r\n",
       "was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on\r\n",
       "Sundays ­accidentally.  Tom had no handkerchief,\r\n",
       "and he looked upon boys who had as snobs. The congregation being fully assembled,\r\n",
       "now, the bell rang once more, to warn laggards and\r\n",
       "stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the church\r\n",
       "which was only broken by the tittering and whispering\r\n",
       "of the choir in the gallery.  The choir always\r\n",
       "tittered and whispered all through service.  There\r\n",
       "was once a church choir that was not ill-bred, but\r\n",
       "I have forgotten where it was, now.  It was a great\r\n",
       "many years ago, and I can scarcely remember anything\r\n",
       "about it, but I think it was in some foreign country. The minister gave out the hymn, and\r\n",
       "read it through with a relish, in a peculiar style\r\n",
       "which was much admired in that part of the country. \r\n",
       "His voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily\r\n",
       "up till it reached a certain point, where it bore\r\n",
       "with strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then\r\n",
       "plunged down as if from a spring-board:    Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on\r\n",
       "flow’ry beds of ease,   Whilst others fight to win the prize,\r\n",
       "and sail thro’ bloody seas? He was regarded as a wonderful reader. \r\n",
       "At church “sociables” he was always\r\n",
       "called upon to read poetry; and when he was through,\r\n",
       "the ladies would lift up their hands and let them\r\n",
       "fall helplessly in their laps, and “wall”\r\n",
       "their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say,\r\n",
       "“Words cannot express it; it is too beautiful,\r\n",
       "too beautiful for this mortal earth.” After the hymn had been sung, the\r\n",
       "Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into a bulletin-board,\r\n",
       "and read off “notices” of meetings and\r\n",
       "societies and things till it seemed that the list\r\n",
       "would stretch out to the crack of doom ­a\r\n",
       "queer custom which is still kept up in America, even\r\n",
       "in cities, away here in this age of abundant newspapers. \r\n",
       "Often, the less there is to justify a traditional\r\n",
       "custom, the harder it is to get rid of it. And now the minister prayed. \r\n",
       "A good, generous prayer it was, and went into details: \r\n",
       "it pleaded for the church, and the little children\r\n",
       "of the church; for the other churches of the village;\r\n",
       "for the village itself; for the county; for the State;\r\n",
       "for the State officers; for the United States; for\r\n",
       "the churches of the United States; for Congress; for\r\n",
       "the President; for the officers of the Government;\r\n",
       "for poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for the oppressed\r\n",
       "millions groaning under the heel of European monarchies\r\n",
       "and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light\r\n",
       "and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see\r\n",
       "nor ears to hear withal; for the heathen in the far\r\n",
       "islands of the sea; and closed with a supplication\r\n",
       "that the words he was about to speak might find grace\r\n",
       "and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding\r\n",
       "in time a grateful harvest of good.  Amen. There was a rustling of dresses, and\r\n",
       "the standing congregation sat down.  The boy whose\r\n",
       "history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer,\r\n",
       "he only endured it ­if he even did that much. \r\n",
       "He was restive all through it; he kept tally of the\r\n",
       "details of the prayer, unconsciously  ­for\r\n",
       "he was not listening, but he knew the ground of old,\r\n",
       "and the clergyman’s regular route over it ­and\r\n",
       "when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,\r\n",
       "his ear detected it and his whole nature resented\r\n",
       "it; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. \r\n",
       "In the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back\r\n",
       "of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit\r\n",
       "by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its\r\n",
       "head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously\r\n",
       "that it seemed to almost part company with the body,\r\n",
       "and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view;\r\n",
       "scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing\r\n",
       "them to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going\r\n",
       "through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew\r\n",
       "it was perfectly safe.  As indeed it was; for\r\n",
       "as sorely as Tom’s hands itched to grab for\r\n",
       "it they did not dare ­he believed his soul\r\n",
       "would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing\r\n",
       "while the prayer was going on.  But with the closing\r\n",
       "sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward;\r\n",
       "and the instant the “Amen” was out the\r\n",
       "fly was a prisoner of war.  His aunt detected\r\n",
       "the act and made him let it go. The minister gave out his text and\r\n",
       "droned along monotonously through an argument that\r\n",
       "was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod\r\n",
       " ­and yet it was an argument that dealt in\r\n",
       "limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined\r\n",
       "elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth\r\n",
       "the saving.  Tom counted the pages of the sermon;\r\n",
       "after church he always knew how many pages there had\r\n",
       "been, but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse. \r\n",
       "However, this time he was really interested for a\r\n",
       "little while.  The minister made a grand and moving\r\n",

       "miserable.  Monday morning always found him so ­because\r\n",
       "it began another week’s slow suffering in school. \r\n",
       "He generally began that day with wishing he had had\r\n",
       "no intervening holiday, it made the going into captivity\r\n",
       "and fetters again so much more odious. Tom lay thinking.  Presently it\r\n",
       "occurred to him that he wished he was sick; then he\r\n",
       "could stay home from school.  Here was a vague\r\n",
       "possibility.  He canvassed his system.  No\r\n",
       "ailment was found, and he investigated again. \r\n",
       "This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms,\r\n",
       "and he began to encourage them with considerable hope. \r\n",
       "But they soon grew feeble, and presently died wholly\r\n",
       "away.  He reflected further.  Suddenly he\r\n",
       "discovered something.  One of his upper front teeth\r\n",
       "was loose.  This was lucky; he was about to begin\r\n",
       "to groan, as a “starter,” as he called\r\n",
       "it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court\r\n",
       "with that argument, his aunt would pull it out, and\r\n",
       "that would hurt.  So he thought he would hold\r\n",
       "the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further. \r\n",
       "Nothing offered for some little time, and then he\r\n",
       "remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain\r\n",
       "thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks\r\n",
       "and threatened to make him lose a finger.  So\r\n",
       "the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet\r\n",
       "and held it up for inspection.  But now he did\r\n",
       "not know the necessary symptoms.  However, it\r\n",
       "seemed well worth while to chance it, so he fell to\r\n",
       "groaning with considerable spirit. But Sid slept on unconscious. Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel\r\n",
       "pain in the toe. No result from Sid. Tom was panting with his exertions\r\n",
       "by this time.  He took a rest and then swelled\r\n",
       "himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans. Sid snored on. Tom was aggravated.  He said,\r\n",
       "“Sid, Sid!” and shook him.  This course\r\n",
       "worked well, and Tom began to groan again.  Sid\r\n",
       "yawned, stretched, then brought himself up on his\r\n",
       "elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom. \r\n",
       "Tom went on groaning.  Sid said:  “Tom!  Say, Tom!”\r\n",
       "{[}No response.{]} “Here, Tom!  Tom! \r\n",
       "What is the matter, Tom?” And he shook him and\r\n",
       "looked in his face anxiously. Tom moaned out:  “Oh, don’t, Sid.  Don’t joggle\r\n",
       "me.” “Why, what’s the matter, Tom?  I must\r\n",
       "call auntie.” “No ­never mind.  It’ll\r\n",
       "be over by and by, maybe.  Don’t call anybody.” “But I must!  Don’t\r\n",
       "groan so, Tom, it’s awful.  How long you\r\n",
       "been this way?” “Hours.  Ouch!  Oh, don’t stir\r\n",
       "so, Sid, you’ll kill me.” “Tom, why didn’t you wake\r\n",
       "me sooner?  Oh, Tom, don’t!  It\r\n",
       "makes my flesh crawl to hear you.  Tom, what is\r\n",
       "the matter?” “I forgive you everything, Sid.\r\n",

       "that’s come to town, and tell her ­” But Sid had snatched his clothes and\r\n",
       "gone.  Tom was suffering in reality, now, so handsomely\r\n",
       "was his imagination working, and so his groans had\r\n",
       "gathered quite a genuine tone. Sid flew down-stairs and said:  “Oh, Aunt Polly, come!  Tom’s dying!” “Dying!” “Yes’m.  Don’t wait ­come\r\n",
       "quick!” “Rubbage!  I don’t believe it!” But she fled up-stairs, nevertheless,\r\n",
       "with Sid and Mary at her heels.  And her face\r\n",
       "grew white, too, and her lip trembled.  When she\r\n",
       "reached the bedside she gasped out:  “You, Tom!  Tom, what’s the matter\r\n",
       "with you?” “Oh, auntie, I’m ­” “What’s the matter with you ­what\r\n",
       "is the matter with you, child?” “Oh, auntie, my sore toe’s mortified!” The old lady sank down into a chair\r\n",
       "and laughed a little, then cried a little, then did\r\n",
       "both together.  This restored her and she said:  “Tom, what a turn you did give\r\n",
       "me.  Now you shut up that nonsense and climb out\r\n",
       "of this.” The groans ceased and the pain vanished\r\n",
       "from the toe.  The boy felt a little foolish,\r\n",
       "and he said:  “Aunt Polly, it seemed\r\n",
       "mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my tooth\r\n",
       "at all.” “Your tooth, indeed!  What’s the matter\r\n",
       "with your tooth?” “One of them’s loose, and it aches perfectly\r\n",
       "awful.” “There, there, now, don’t\r\n",
       "begin that groaning again.  Open your mouth. \r\n",
       "Well ­your tooth is loose, but you’re\r\n",
       "not going to die about that.  Mary, get me a silk\r\n",
       "thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.” Tom said:  “Oh, please, auntie, don’t\r\n",
       "pull it out.  It don’t hurt any more. \r\n",
       "I wish I may never stir if it does.  Please don’t,\r\n",
       "auntie.  I don’t want to stay home from\r\n",
       "school.” “Oh, you don’t, don’t\r\n",
       "you?  So all this row was because you thought\r\n",
       "you’d get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? \r\n",
       "Tom, Tom, I love you so, and you seem to try every\r\n",
       "way you can to break my old heart with your outrageousness.” \r\n",
       "By this time the dental instruments were ready. \r\n",
       "The old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to\r\n",
       "Tom’s tooth with a loop and tied the other to\r\n",
       "the bedpost.  Then she seized the chunk of fire\r\n",
       "and suddenly thrust it almost into the boy’s\r\n",
       "face.  The tooth hung dangling by the bedpost,\r\n",
       "now. But all trials bring their compensations. \r\n",
       "As Tom wended to school after breakfast, he was the\r\n",
       "envy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper\r\n",
       "row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and\r\n",
       "admirable way.  He gathered quite a following of\r\n",
       "lads interested in the exhibition; and one that had\r\n",
       "cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination\r\n",
       "and homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly\r\n",
       "without an adherent, and shorn of his glory.  His\r\n",
       "heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain which\r\n",
       "he did not feel that it wasn’t anything to spit\r\n",
       "like Tom Sawyer; but another boy said, “Sour\r\n",
       "grapes!” and he wandered away a dismantled hero. Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile\r\n",
       "pariah of the village, Huckleberry Finn, son of the\r\n",
       "town drunkard.  Huckleberry was cordially hated\r\n",
       "and dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because\r\n",
       "he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad ­and\r\n",
       "because all their children admired him so, and delighted\r\n",
       "in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to\r\n",
       "be like him.  Tom was like the rest of the respectable\r\n",
       "boys, in that he envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast\r\n",
       "condition, and was under strict orders not to play\r\n",
       "with him.  So he played with him every time he\r\n",
       "got a chance.  Huckleberry was always dressed\r\n",
       "in the cast-off clothes of full-grown men, and they\r\n",
       "were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. \r\n",
       "His hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped\r\n",
       "out of its brim; his coat, when he wore one, hung\r\n",
       "nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far\r\n",
       "down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers;\r\n",
       "the seat of the trousers bagged low and contained\r\n",
       "nothing, the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when\r\n",
       "not rolled up. Huckleberry came and went, at his\r\n",
       "own free will.  He slept on doorsteps in fine\r\n",
       "weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have\r\n",
       "to go to school or to church, or call any being master\r\n",
       "or obey anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when\r\n",
       "and where he chose, and stay as long as it suited\r\n",
       "him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as\r\n",
       "late as he pleased; he was always the first boy that\r\n",
       "went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume\r\n",
       "leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put\r\n",
       "on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. \r\n",
       "In a word, everything that goes to make life precious\r\n",
       "that boy had.  So thought every harassed, hampered,\r\n",
       "respectable boy in St. Petersburg. Tom hailed the romantic outcast:  “Hello, Huckleberry!” “Hello yourself, and see how you like it.” “What’s that you got?” “Dead cat.” “Lemme see him, Huck.  My, he’s pretty\r\n",
       "stiff.  Where’d you get him?” “Bought him off’n a boy.” “What did you give?” “I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got\r\n",
       "at the slaughter-house.” “Where’d you get the blue ticket?” “Bought it off’n Ben Rogers two weeks\r\n",
       "ago for a hoop-stick.” “Say ­what is dead cats good for,\r\n",
       "Huck?” “Good for?  Cure warts with.” “No!  Is that so?  I know something\r\n",
       "that’s better.” “I bet you don’t.  What is it?” “Why, spunk-water.” “Spunk-water!  I wouldn’t give a dern\r\n",
       "for spunk-water.” “You wouldn’t, wouldn’t you? \r\n",
       "D’you ever try it?” “No, I hain’t.  But Bob Tanner did.” “Who told you so!” “Why, he told Jeff Thatcher,\r\n",
       "and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny told Jim Hollis,\r\n",
       "and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and\r\n",
       "the nigger told me.  There now!” “Well, what of it?  They’ll\r\n",
       "all lie.  Leastways all but the nigger.  I\r\n",
       "don’t know him.  But I never see a nigger\r\n",
       "that wouldn’t lie.  Shucks!  Now\r\n",
       "you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.” “Why, he took and dipped his\r\n",
       "hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water was.” “In the daytime?” “Certainly.” “With his face to the stump?” “Yes.  Least I reckon so.” “Did he say anything?” “I don’t reckon he did.  I don’t\r\n",
       "know.” “Aha!  Talk about trying\r\n",
       "to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool way\r\n",
       "as that!  Why, that ain’t a-going to do any\r\n",
       "good.  You got to go all by yourself, to the middle\r\n",
       "of the woods, where you know there’s a spunk-water\r\n",
       "stump, and just as it’s midnight you back up\r\n",

       "becuz he’s the wartiest boy in this town; and\r\n",
       "he wouldn’t have a wart on him if he’d\r\n",

       "I play with frogs so much that I’ve always got\r\n",
       "considerable many warts.  Sometimes I take ’em\r\n",
       "off with a bean.” “Yes, bean’s good.  I’ve done\r\n",
       "that.” “Have you?  What’s your way?” “You take and split the bean,\r\n",
       "and cut the wart so as to get some blood, and then\r\n",
       "you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take\r\n",
       "and dig a hole and bury it ’bout midnight at\r\n",
       "the crossroads in the dark of the moon, and then you\r\n",
       "burn up the rest of the bean.  You see that piece\r\n",
       "that’s got the blood on it will keep drawing\r\n",
       "and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it,\r\n",
       "and so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and\r\n",
       "pretty soon off she comes.” “Yes, that’s it, Huck ­that’s\r\n",

       "‘Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother\r\n",

       "fetch any wart.” “Sounds right.  D’you ever try it,\r\n",
       "Huck?” “No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.” “Well, I reckon it’s so, then.  Becuz\r\n",
       "they say she’s a witch.” “Say!  Why, Tom, I know\r\n",

       "hadn’t dodged, he’d a got her.  Well,\r\n",
       "that very night he rolled off’n a shed wher’\r\n",
       "he was a layin drunk, and broke his arm.” “Why, that’s awful.  How did he know\r\n",
       "she was a-witching him?” “Lord, pap can tell, easy. \r\n",
       "Pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy,\r\n",

       "after old Hoss Williams to-night.” “But they buried him Saturday.  Didn’t\r\n",
       "they get him Saturday night?” “Why, how you talk!  How\r\n",
       "could their charms work till midnight? ­and\r\n",
       "then it’s Sunday.  Devils don’t\r\n",
       "slosh around much of a Sunday, I don’t reckon.” “I never thought of that.  That’s\r\n",
       "so.  Lemme go with you?” “Of course ­if you ain’t afeard.” “Afeard!  ’Tain’t likely. \r\n",
       "Will you meow?” “Yes ­and you meow\r\n",
       "back, if you get a chance.  Last time, you kep’\r\n",
       "me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing\r\n",
       "rocks at me and says ‘Dern that cat!’\r\n",
       "and so I hove a brick through his window ­but\r\n",
       "don’t you tell.” “I won’t.  I couldn’t\r\n",
       "meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but\r\n",
       "I’ll meow this time.  Say ­what’s\r\n",
       "that?” “Nothing but a tick.” “Where’d you get him?” “Out in the woods.” “What’ll you take for him?” “I don’t know.  I don’t want\r\n",
       "to sell him.” “All right.  It’s a mighty small tick,\r\n",
       "anyway.” “Oh, anybody can run a tick\r\n",
       "down that don’t belong to them.  I’m\r\n",
       "satisfied with it.  It’s a good enough tick\r\n",
       "for me.” “Sho, there’s ticks a\r\n",
       "plenty.  I could have a thousand of ’em if\r\n",
       "I wanted to.” “Well, why don’t you? \r\n",
       "Becuz you know mighty well you can’t.  This\r\n",
       "is a pretty early tick, I reckon.  It’s\r\n",
       "the first one I’ve seen this year.” “Say, Huck ­I’ll give you my\r\n",
       "tooth for him.” “Less see it.” Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully\r\n",
       "unrolled it.  Huckleberry viewed it wistfully. \r\n",
       "The temptation was very strong.  At last he said:  “Is it genuwyne?” Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy. “Well, all right,” said Huckleberry, “it’s\r\n",
       "a trade.” Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap\r\n",
       "box that had lately been the pinchbug’s prison,\r\n",
       "and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than\r\n",
       "before. When Tom reached the little isolated\r\n",
       "frame schoolhouse, he strode in briskly, with the\r\n",
       "manner of one who had come with all honest speed. \r\n",
       "He hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his\r\n",
       "seat with business-like alacrity.  The master,\r\n",
       "throned on high in his great splint-bottom arm-chair,\r\n",
       "was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. \r\n",
       "The interruption roused him. “Thomas Sawyer!” Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full,\r\n",
       "it meant trouble. “Sir!” “Come up here.  Now, sir, why are you late\r\n",
       "again, as usual?” Tom was about to take refuge in a\r\n",
       "lie, when he saw two long tails of yellow hair hanging\r\n",
       "down a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy\r\n",
       "of love; and by that form was the only vacant\r\n",
       "place on the girls’ side of the schoolhouse. \r\n",
       "He instantly said:  “I stopped to talk with\r\n",
       "Huckleberry Finn!” The master’s pulse stood still,\r\n",
       "and he stared helplessly.  The buzz of study ceased. \r\n",
       "The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost\r\n",
       "his mind.  The master said:  “You ­you did what?” “Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.” There was no mistaking the words. “Thomas Sawyer, this is the\r\n",
       "most astounding confession I have ever listened to. \r\n",
       "No mere ferule will answer for this offence.  Take\r\n",
       "off your jacket.” The master’s arm performed until\r\n",
       "it was tired and the stock of switches notably diminished. \r\n",
       "Then the order followed:  “Now, sir, go and sit with the girls!  And\r\n",
       "let this be a warning to you.” The titter that rippled around the\r\n",
       "room appeared to abash the boy, but in reality that\r\n",
       "result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe\r\n",
       "of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay\r\n",
       "in his high good fortune.  He sat down upon the\r\n",
       "end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself\r\n",
       "away from him with a toss of her head.  Nudges\r\n",
       "and winks and whispers traversed the room, but Tom\r\n",
       "sat still, with his arms upon the long, low desk before\r\n",
       "him, and seemed to study his book. By and by attention ceased from him,\r\n",
       "and the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull\r\n",
       "air once more.  Presently the boy began to steal\r\n",
       "furtive glances at the girl.  She observed it,\r\n",
       "“made a mouth” at him and gave him the\r\n",
       "back of her head for the space of a minute.  When\r\n",
       "she cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before\r\n",
       "her.  She thrust it away.  Tom gently put\r\n",
       "it back.  She thrust it away again, but with less\r\n",
       "animosity.  Tom patiently returned it to its place. \r\n",
       "Then she let it remain.  Tom scrawled on his slate,\r\n",
       "“Please take it ­I got more.” \r\n",
       "The girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. \r\n",
       "Now the boy began to draw something on the slate,\r\n",
       "hiding his work with his left hand.  For a time\r\n",
       "the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity\r\n",
       "presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible\r\n",
       "signs.  The boy worked on, apparently unconscious. \r\n",
       "The girl made a sort of noncommittal attempt to see,\r\n",
       "but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. \r\n",
       "At last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered:  “Let me see it.” Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature\r\n",
       "of a house with two gable ends to it and a corkscrew\r\n",
       "of smoke issuing from the chimney.  Then the girl’s\r\n",
       "interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she\r\n",
       "forgot everything else.  When it was finished,\r\n",
       "she gazed a moment, then whispered:  “It’s nice ­make a man.” The artist erected a man in the front\r\n",
       "yard, that resembled a derrick.  He could have\r\n",
       "stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;\r\n",
       "she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:  “It’s a beautiful man ­now make\r\n",
       "me coming along.” Tom drew an hour-glass with a full\r\n",
       "moon and straw limbs to it and armed the spreading\r\n",
       "fingers with a portentous fan.  The girl said:  “It’s ever so nice ­I wish I\r\n",
       "could draw.” “It’s easy,” whispered Tom, “I’ll\r\n",
       "learn you.” “Oh, will you?  When?” “At noon.  Do you go home to dinner?” “I’ll stay if you will.” “Good ­that’s a whack. \r\n",
       "What’s your name?” “Becky Thatcher.  What’s yours? \r\n",
       "Oh, I know.  It’s Thomas Sawyer.” “That’s the name they\r\n",
       "lick me by.  I’m Tom when I’m good. \r\n",
       "You call me Tom, will you?” “Yes.” Now Tom began to scrawl something\r\n",
       "on the slate, hiding the words from the girl. \r\n",
       "But she was not backward this time.  She begged\r\n",
       "to see.  Tom said:  “Oh, it ain’t anything.” “Yes it is.” “No it ain’t.  You don’t want\r\n",
       "to see.” “Yes I do, indeed I do.  Please let me.” “You’ll tell.” “No I won’t ­deed and deed and\r\n",
       "double deed won’t.” “You won’t tell anybody at all?  Ever,\r\n",
       "as long as you live?” “No, I won’t ever tell ANYbody.  Now\r\n",
       "let me.” “Oh, you don’t want to see!” “Now that you treat me so, I\r\n",
       "will see.”  And she put her small hand\r\n",
       "upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending\r\n",
       "to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by\r\n",
       "degrees till these words were revealed:  “I\r\n",
       "love you.” “Oh, you bad thing!” And\r\n",
       "she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and looked\r\n",
       "pleased, nevertheless. Just at this juncture the boy felt\r\n",
       "a slow, fateful grip closing on his ear, and a steady\r\n",
       "lifting impulse.  In that wise he was borne across\r\n",
       "the house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering\r\n",
       "fire of giggles from the whole school.  Then the\r\n",
       "master stood over him during a few awful moments,\r\n",
       "and finally moved away to his throne without saying\r\n",
       "a word.  But although Tom’s ear tingled,\r\n",
       "his heart was jubilant. As the school quieted down Tom made\r\n",
       "an honest effort to study, but the turmoil within\r\n",
       "him was too great.  In turn he took his place in\r\n",
       "the reading class and made a botch of it; then in\r\n",
       "the geography class and turned lakes into mountains,\r\n",
       "mountains into rivers, and rivers into continents,\r\n",
       "till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class,\r\n",
       "and got “turned down,” by a succession\r\n",
       "of mere baby words, till he brought up at the foot\r\n",
       "and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with\r\n",
       "ostentation for months.                              \\\\\n",

       "in it and looked out among the tomato vines and “jimpson”\r\n",
       "weeds that constituted the garden.  No Tom. \r\n",
       "So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for\r\n",
       "distance and shouted:  “Y-o-u-u Tom!” There was a slight noise behind her\r\n",
       "and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by\r\n",

       "to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day’s\r\n",

       "stealing sugar as opportunity offered, Aunt Polly\r\n",
       "asked him questions that were full of guile, and very\r\n",
       "deep ­for she wanted to trap him into damaging\r\n",
       "revealments.  Like many other simple-hearted souls,\r\n",
       "it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with\r\n",
       "a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she\r\n",
       "loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as\r\n",
       "marvels of low cunning.  Said she:  “Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn’t\r\n",
       "it?” “Yes’m.” “Powerful warm, warn’t it?” “Yes’m.” “Didn’t you want to go in a-swimming,\r\n",
       "Tom?” A bit of a scare shot through Tom ­a\r\n",
       "touch of uncomfortable suspicion.  He searched\r\n",
       "Aunt Polly’s face, but it told him nothing. \r\n",
       "So he said:  “No’m ­well, not very much.” The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom’s\r\n",
       "shirt, and said:  “But you ain’t too warm\r\n",
       "now, though.”  And it flattered her to reflect\r\n",
       "that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without\r\n",
       "anybody knowing that that was what she had in her\r\n",
       "mind.  But in spite of her, Tom knew where the\r\n",
       "wind lay, now.  So he forestalled what might be\r\n",
       "the next move:  “Some of us pumped on our heads ­mine’s\r\n",
       "damp yet.  See?” Aunt Polly was vexed to think she\r\n",
       "had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence,\r\n",
       "and missed a trick.  Then she had a new inspiration:  “Tom, you didn’t have\r\n",
       "to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump\r\n",
       "on your head, did you?  Unbutton your jacket!” The trouble vanished out of Tom’s\r\n",
       "face.  He opened his jacket.  His shirt collar\r\n",
       "was securely sewed. “Bother!  Well, go ’long\r\n",
       "with you.  I’d made sure you’d played\r\n",
       "hookey and been a-swimming.  But I forgive ye,\r\n",
       "Tom.  I reckon you’re a kind of a singed\r\n",
       "cat, as the saying is ­better’n you\r\n",
       "look.  This time.” She was half sorry her sagacity had\r\n",
       "miscarried, and half glad that Tom had stumbled into\r\n",
       "obedient conduct for once. But Sidney said:  “Well, now, if I didn’t\r\n",
       "think you sewed his collar with white thread, but\r\n",
       "it’s black.” “Why, I did sew it with white!  Tom!” But Tom did not wait for the rest.  As he went\r\n",
       "out at the door he said:  “Siddy, I’ll lick you for that.” In a safe place Tom examined two large\r\n",
       "needles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket,\r\n",
       "and had thread bound about them ­one needle\r\n",
       "carried white thread and the other black.  He said:  “She’d never noticed if\r\n",
       "it hadn’t been for Sid.  Confound it! sometimes\r\n",
       "she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with\r\n",
       "black.  I wish to geeminy she’d stick to\r\n",
       "one or t’other ­I can’t keep\r\n",
       "the run of ’em.  But I bet you I’ll\r\n",
       "lam Sid for that.  I’ll learn him!” He was not the Model Boy of the village. \r\n",
       "He knew the model boy very well though ­and\r\n",
       "loathed him. Within two minutes, or even less,\r\n",
       "he had forgotten all his troubles.  Not because\r\n",
       "his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to\r\n",
       "him than a man’s are to a man, but because a\r\n",
       "new and powerful interest bore them down and drove\r\n",
       "them out of his mind for the time ­just as\r\n",
       "men’s misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement\r\n",
       "of new enterprises.  This new interest was a valued\r\n",
       "novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from\r\n",
       "a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. \r\n",
       "It consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of\r\n",
       "liquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to\r\n",
       "the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst\r\n",
       "of the music ­the reader probably remembers\r\n",
       "how to do it, if he has ever been a boy.  Diligence\r\n",
       "and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he\r\n",
       "strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony\r\n",
       "and his soul full of gratitude.  He felt much as\r\n",
       "an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet ­no\r\n",
       "doubt, as far as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure\r\n",
       "is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not\r\n",
       "the astronomer. The summer evenings were long. \r\n",
       "It was not dark, yet.  Presently Tom checked his\r\n",
       "whistle.  A stranger was before him ­a\r\n",
       "boy a shade larger than himself.  A new-comer\r\n",
       "of any age or either sex was an impressive curiosity\r\n",
       "in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. \r\n",
       "This boy was well dressed, too ­well dressed\r\n",
       "on a week-day.  This was simply astounding. \r\n",
       "His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue\r\n",
       "cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his\r\n",
       "pantaloons.  He had shoes on ­and it\r\n",
       "was only Friday.  He even wore a necktie, a bright\r\n",
       "bit of ribbon.  He had a citified air about him\r\n",
       "that ate into Tom’s vitals.  The more Tom\r\n",
       "stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned\r\n",
       "up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier\r\n",
       "his own outfit seemed to him to grow.  Neither\r\n",
       "boy spoke.  If one moved, the other moved ­but\r\n",
       "only sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face\r\n",
       "and eye to eye all the time.  Finally Tom said:  “I can lick you!” “I’d like to see you try it.” “Well, I can do it.” “No you can’t, either.” “Yes I can.” “No you can’t.” “I can.” “You can’t.” “Can!” “Can’t!” An uncomfortable pause.  Then Tom said:  “What’s your name?” “’Tisn’t any of your business, maybe.” “Well I ’low I’ll make it my\r\n",
       "business.” “Well why don’t you?” “If you say much, I will.” “Much ­much ­much. \r\n",
       "There now.” “Oh, you think you’re\r\n",
       "mighty smart, don’t you?  I could lick\r\n",
       "you with one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.” “Well why don’t you do it?  You\r\n",
       "say you can do it.” “Well I will, if you fool with me.” “Oh yes ­I’ve seen whole families\r\n",
       "in the same fix.” “Smarty!  You think you’re some,\r\n",
       "now, don’t you?  Oh, what a hat!” “You can lump that hat if you\r\n",
       "don’t like it.  I dare you to knock it off ­and\r\n",
       "anybody that’ll take a dare will suck eggs.” “You’re a liar!” “You’re another.” “You’re a fighting liar and dasn’t\r\n",
       "take it up.” “Aw ­take a walk!” “Say ­if you give\r\n",
       "me much more of your sass I’ll take and bounce\r\n",
       "a rock off’n your head.” “Oh, of course you will.” “Well I will.” “Well why don’t you do\r\n",
       "it then?  What do you keep saying you will\r\n",
       "for?  Why don’t you do it?  It’s\r\n",
       "because you’re afraid.” “I ain’t afraid.” “You are.” “I ain’t.” “You are.” Another pause, and more eying and\r\n",
       "sidling around each other.  Presently they were\r\n",
       "shoulder to shoulder.  Tom said:  “Get away from here!” “Go away yourself!” “I won’t.” “I won’t either.” So they stood, each with a foot placed\r\n",
       "at an angle as a brace, and both shoving with might\r\n",
       "and main, and glowering at each other with hate. \r\n",
       "But neither could get an advantage.  After struggling\r\n",
       "till both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain\r\n",
       "with watchful caution, and Tom said:  “You’re a coward and a\r\n",
       "pup.  I’ll tell my big brother on you, and\r\n",
       "he can thrash you with his little finger, and I’ll\r\n",
       "make him do it, too.” “What do I care for your big\r\n",
       "brother?  I’ve got a brother that’s\r\n",
       "bigger than he is ­and what’s more,\r\n",
       "he can throw him over that fence, too.” [Both\r\n",
       "brothers were imaginary.] “That’s a lie.” “Your saying so don’t make it so.” Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and\r\n",
       "said:  “I dare you to step over that,\r\n",
       "and I’ll lick you till you can’t stand\r\n",
       "up.  Anybody that’ll take a dare will steal\r\n",
       "sheep.” The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:  “Now you said you’d do it, now let’s\r\n",
       "see you do it.” “Don’t you crowd me now; you better look\r\n",
       "out.” “Well, you said you’d do it ­why\r\n",
       "don’t you do it?” “By jingo! for two cents I will do it.” The new boy took two broad coppers\r\n",
       "out of his pocket and held them out with derision. \r\n",
       "Tom struck them to the ground.  In an instant both\r\n",
       "boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped\r\n",
       "together like cats; and for the space of a minute\r\n",
       "they tugged and tore at each other’s hair and\r\n",
       "clothes, punched and scratched each other’s nose,\r\n",
       "and covered themselves with dust and glory.  Presently\r\n",
       "the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle\r\n",
       "Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding\r\n",
       "him with his fists.  “Holler ’nuff!”\r\n",
       "said he. The boy only struggled to free himself.  He was\r\n",
       "crying ­mainly from rage. “Holler ’nuff!” ­and the\r\n",
       "pounding went on. At last the stranger got out a smothered\r\n",
       "“’Nuff!” and Tom let him up and\r\n",
       "said:  “Now that’ll learn you. \r\n",
       "Better look out who you’re fooling with next\r\n",
       "time.” The new boy went off brushing the\r\n",
       "dust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally\r\n",
       "looking back and shaking his head and threatening\r\n",
       "what he would do to Tom the “next time he caught\r\n",
       "him out.”  To which Tom responded with jeers,\r\n",
       "and started off in high feather, and as soon as his\r\n",
       "back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw\r\n",
       "it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned\r\n",
       "tail and ran like an antelope.  Tom chased the\r\n",
       "traitor home, and thus found out where he lived. \r\n",
       "He then held a position at the gate for some time,\r\n",
       "daring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only\r\n",
       "made faces at him through the window and declined. \r\n",
       "At last the enemy’s mother appeared, and called\r\n",
       "Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. \r\n",
       "So he went away; but he said he “’lowed”\r\n",
       "to “lay” for that boy. He got home pretty late that night,\r\n",
       "and when he climbed cautiously in at the window, he\r\n",
       "uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt;\r\n",
       "and when she saw the state his clothes were in her\r\n",
       "resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity\r\n",
       "at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness.

       "| 2 | Saturday morning was come, and\r\n",
       "all the summer world was bright and fresh, and brimming\r\n",
       "with life.  There was a song in every heart; and\r\n",
       "if the heart was young the music issued at the lips. \r\n",
       "There was cheer in every face and a spring in every\r\n",
       "step.  The locust-trees were in bloom and the\r\n",
       "fragrance of the blossoms filled the air.  Cardiff\r\n",
       "Hill, beyond the village and above it, was green with\r\n",
       "vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem\r\n",
       "a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting. Tom appeared on the sidewalk with\r\n",
       "a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. \r\n",
       "He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and\r\n",
       "a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. \r\n",
       "Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high.  Life\r\n",
       "to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. \r\n",
       "Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the\r\n",
       "topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again;\r\n",
       "compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with\r\n",
       "the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence,\r\n",
       "and sat down on a tree-box discouraged.  Jim came\r\n",
       "skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and singing\r\n",
       "Buffalo Gals.  Bringing water from the town pump\r\n",
       "had always been hateful work in Tom’s eyes, before,\r\n",
       "but now it did not strike him so.  He remembered\r\n",
       "that there was company at the pump.  White, mulatto,\r\n",
       "and negro boys and girls were always there waiting\r\n",
       "their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling,\r\n",
       "fighting, skylarking.  And he remembered that although\r\n",
       "the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim\r\n",
       "never got back with a bucket of water under an hour ­and\r\n",
       "even then somebody generally had to go after him. \r\n",
       "Tom said:  “Say, Jim, I’ll fetch\r\n",
       "the water if you’ll whitewash some.” Jim shook his head and said:  “Can’t, Mars Tom. \r\n",

       "’tend to de whitewashin’.” “Oh, never you mind what she\r\n",
       "said, Jim.  That’s the way she always talks. \r\n",
       "Gimme the bucket ­I won’t be gone only\r\n",
       "a a minute.  She won’t ever know.” “Oh, I dasn’t, Mars Tom. \r\n",
       "Olé missis she’d take an’ tar de head\r\n",
       "off’n me.  ’Deed she would.” “She!  She never licks\r\n",
       "anybody ­whacks ’em over the head with\r\n",
       "her thimble ­and who cares for that, I’d\r\n",
       "like to know.  She talks awful, but talk don’t\r\n",

       "cry.  Jim, I’ll give you a marvel. \r\n",
       "I’ll give you a white alley!” Jim began to waver. “White alley, Jim!  And it’s a bully\r\n",
       "taw.” “My!  Dat’s a mighty\r\n",
       "gay marvel, I tell you!  But Mars Tom I’s\r\n",
       "powerful ’fraid olé missis ­” “And besides, if you will I’ll show you\r\n",
       "my sore toe.” Jim was only human ­this\r\n",
       "attraction was too much for him.  He put down\r\n",
       "his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe\r\n",
       "with absorbing interest while the bandage was being\r\n",
       "unwound.  In another moment he was flying down\r\n",
       "the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was\r\n",
       "whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring\r\n",
       "from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph\r\n",
       "in her eye. But Tom’s energy did not last. \r\n",
       "He began to think of the fun he had planned for this\r\n",
       "day, and his sorrows multiplied.  Soon the free\r\n",
       "boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious\r\n",
       "expeditions, and they would make a world of fun of\r\n",
       "him for having to work ­the very thought\r\n",
       "of it burnt him like fire.  He got out his worldly\r\n",
       "wealth and examined it ­bits of toys, marbles,\r\n",
       "and trash; enough to buy an exchange of work,\r\n",
       "maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an\r\n",
       "hour of pure freedom.  So he returned his straitened\r\n",
       "means to his pocket, and gave up the idea of trying\r\n",
       "to buy the boys.  At this dark and hopeless moment\r\n",
       "an inspiration burst upon him!  Nothing less than\r\n",
       "a great, magnificent inspiration. He took up his brush and went tranquilly\r\n",
       "to work.  Ben Rogers hove in sight presently ­the\r\n",
       "very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been\r\n",
       "dreading.  Ben’s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump ­proof\r\n",
       "enough that his heart was light and his anticipations\r\n",
       "high.  He was eating an apple, and giving a long,\r\n",
       "melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned\r\n",
       "ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating\r\n",
       "a steamboat.  As he drew near, he slackened speed,\r\n",
       "took the middle of the street, leaned far over to\r\n",
       "starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious\r\n",
       "pomp and circumstance ­for he was personating\r\n",
       "the Big Missouri, and considered himself to be drawing\r\n",
       "nine feet of water.  He was boat and captain and\r\n",
       "engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself\r\n",
       "standing on his own hurricane-deck giving the orders\r\n",
       "and executing them:  “Stop her, sir!  Ting-a-ling-ling!”\r\n",
       "The headway ran almost out, and he drew up slowly\r\n",
       "toward the sidewalk. “Ship up to back!  Ting-a-ling-ling!”\r\n",
       "His arms straightened and stiffened down his sides. “Set her back on the stabboard! \r\n",
       "Ting-a-ling-ling!  Chow! ch-chow-wow! \r\n",
       "Chow!” His right hand, meantime, describing stately\r\n",
       "circles ­for it was representing a forty-foot\r\n",
       "wheel. “Let her go back on the labboard! \r\n",
       "Ting-a-lingling!  Chow-ch-chow-chow!”\r\n",
       "The left hand began to describe circles. “Stop the stabboard!  Ting-a-ling-ling! \r\n",
       "Stop the labboard!  Come ahead on the stabboard! \r\n",
       "Stop her!  Let your outside turn over slow! \r\n",

       "head-line!  Lively now!  Come ­out\r\n",
       "with your spring-line ­what’re you\r\n",
       "about there!  Take a turn round that stump with\r\n",
       "the bight of it!  Stand by that stage, now ­let\r\n",
       "her go!  Done with the engines, sir!  Ting-a-ling-ling! \r\n",
       "SH’T!  S’H’T!  SH’T!”\r\n",
       "(trying the gauge-cocks). Tom went on whitewashing ­paid\r\n",
       "no attention to the steamboat.  Ben stared a moment\r\n",
       "and then said:  “Hi-Yi!  You’re\r\n",
       "up a stump, ain’t you!” No answer.  Tom surveyed his last\r\n",
       "touch with the eye of an artist, then he gave his\r\n",
       "brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result,\r\n",
       "as before.  Ben ranged up alongside of him. \r\n",
       "Tom’s mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck\r\n",
       "to his work.  Ben said:  “Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?” Tom wheeled suddenly and said:  “Why, it’s you, Ben!  I warn’t\r\n",
       "noticing.” “Say ­I’m going\r\n",
       "in a-swimming, I am.  Don’t you wish you\r\n",
       "could?  But of course you’d druther work ­wouldn’t\r\n",
       "you?  Course you would!” Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:  “What do you call work?” “Why, ain’t that work?” Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:  “Well, maybe it is, and maybe\r\n",
       "it ain’t.  All I know, is, it suits Tom\r\n",
       "Sawyer.” “Oh come, now, you don’t mean to let on\r\n",
       "that you like it?” The brush continued to move. “Like it?  Well, I don’t\r\n",
       "see why I oughtn’t to like it.  Does a boy\r\n",
       "get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?” That put the thing in a new light. \r\n",
       "Ben stopped nibbling his apple.  Tom swept his\r\n",
       "brush daintily back and forth ­stepped back\r\n",
       "to note the effect ­added a touch here and\r\n",
       "there ­criticised the effect again ­Ben\r\n",
       "watching every move and getting more and more interested,\r\n",
       "more and more absorbed.  Presently he said:  “Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.” Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered\r\n",
       "his mind:  “No ­no ­I\r\n",
       "reckon it wouldn’t hardly do, Ben.  You see,\r\n",
       "Aunt Polly’s awful particular about this fence ­right\r\n",
       "here on the street, you know  ­but if it\r\n",
       "was the back fence I wouldn’t mind and she\r\n",
       "wouldn’t.  Yes, she’s awful particular\r\n",
       "about this fence; it’s got to be done very careful;\r\n",
       "I reckon there ain’t one boy in a thousand, maybe\r\n",
       "two thousand, that can do it the way it’s got\r\n",
       "to be done.” “No ­is that so? \r\n",
       "Oh come, now ­lemme just try.  Only\r\n",
       "just a little ­I’d let you, if\r\n",
       "you was me, Tom.” “Ben, I’d like to, honest\r\n",
       "injun; but Aunt Polly ­well, Jim wanted to\r\n",
       "do it, but she wouldn’t let him; Sid wanted to\r\n",
       "do it, and she wouldn’t let Sid.  Now don’t\r\n",
       "you see how I’m fixed?  If you was to tackle\r\n",
       "this fence and anything was to happen to it ­” “Oh, shucks, I’ll be just\r\n",
       "as careful.  Now lemme try.  Say ­I’ll\r\n",
       "give you the core of my apple.” “Well, here ­No, Ben, now don’t. \r\n",
       "I’m afeard ­” “I’ll give you all of it!” Tom gave up the brush with reluctance\r\n",
       "in his face, but alacrity in his heart.  And while\r\n",
       "the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in\r\n",
       "the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the\r\n",
       "shade close by, dangled his legs, munched his apple,\r\n",
       "and planned the slaughter of more innocents. \r\n",
       "There was no lack of material; boys happened along\r\n",
       "every little while; they came to jeer, but remained\r\n",
       "to whitewash.  By the time Ben was fagged out,\r\n",
       "Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for\r\n",
       "a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny\r\n",
       "Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing\r\n",
       "it with ­and so on, and so on, hour after\r\n",
       "hour.  And when the middle of the afternoon came,\r\n",
       "from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning,\r\n",
       "Tom was literally rolling in wealth.  He had besides\r\n",
       "the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part\r\n",
       "of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look\r\n",
       "through, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn’t\r\n",
       "unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper\r\n",

       "| 3 | Tom presented himself before\r\n",
       "Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an open window in a\r\n",
       "pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom, breakfast-room,\r\n",
       "dining-room, and library, combined.  The balmy\r\n",
       "summer air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers,\r\n",
       "and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their\r\n",
       "effect, and she was nodding over her knitting  ­for\r\n",
       "she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in\r\n",
       "her lap.  Her spectacles were propped up on her\r\n",
       "gray head for safety.  She had thought that of\r\n",
       "course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered\r\n",
       "at seeing him place himself in her power again in\r\n",
       "this intrepid way.  He said:  “Mayn’t\r\n",
       "I go and play now, aunt?” “What, a’ready?  How much have you\r\n",
       "done?” “It’s all done, aunt.” “Tom, don’t lie to me ­I can’t\r\n",
       "bear it.” “I ain’t, aunt; it is all done.” Aunt Polly placed small trust in such\r\n",
       "evidence.  She went out to see for herself; and\r\n",
       "she would have been content to find twenty per cent.\r\n",
       "of Tom’s statement true.  When she found\r\n",
       "the entire fence whitewashed, and not only whitewashed\r\n",
       "but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a streak\r\n",
       "added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. \r\n",
       "She said:  “Well, I never!  There’s\r\n",
       "no getting round it, you can work when you’re\r\n",
       "a mind to, Tom.”  And then she diluted the\r\n",
       "compliment by adding, “But it’s powerful\r\n",
       "seldom you’re a mind to, I’m bound to say. \r\n",
       "Well, go ’long and play; but mind you get back\r\n",
       "some time in a week, or I’ll tan you.” She was so overcome by the splendor\r\n",
       "of his achievement that she took him into the closet\r\n",
       "and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him,\r\n",
       "along with an improving lecture upon the added value\r\n",
       "and flavor a treat took to itself when it came without\r\n",
       "sin through virtuous effort.  And while she closed\r\n",
       "with a happy Scriptural flourish, he “hooked”\r\n",
       "a doughnut. Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just\r\n",
       "starting up the outside stairway that led to the back\r\n",
       "rooms on the second floor.  Clods were handy and\r\n",
       "the air was full of them in a twinkling.  They\r\n",
       "raged around Sid like a hail-storm; and before Aunt\r\n",
       "Polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally\r\n",
       "to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal\r\n",
       "effect, and Tom was over the fence and gone. \r\n",
       "There was a gate, but as a general thing he was too\r\n",
       "crowded for time to make use of it.  His soul was\r\n",
       "at peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling\r\n",
       "attention to his black thread and getting him into\r\n",
       "trouble. Tom skirted the block, and came round\r\n",
       "into a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunt’s\r\n",
       "cow-stable.  He presently got safely beyond the\r\n",
       "reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward\r\n",
       "the public square of the village, where two “military”\r\n",
       "companies of boys had met for conflict, according\r\n",
       "to previous appointment.  Tom was General of one\r\n",
       "of these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General\r\n",
       "of the other.  These two great commanders did\r\n",
       "not condescend to fight in person ­that being\r\n",
       "better suited to the still smaller fry ­but\r\n",
       "sat together on an eminence and conducted the field\r\n",
       "operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp. \r\n",
       "Tom’s army won a great victory, after a long\r\n",
       "and hard-fought battle.  Then the dead were counted,\r\n",
       "prisoners exchanged, the terms of the next disagreement\r\n",
       "agreed upon, and the day for the necessary battle\r\n",
       "appointed; after which the armies fell into line and\r\n",
       "marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone. As he was passing by the house where\r\n",
       "Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new girl in the garden ­a\r\n",
       "lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow hair\r\n",
       "plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and\r\n",
       "embroidered pantalettes.  The fresh-crowned hero\r\n",
       "fell without firing a shot.  A certain Amy Lawrence\r\n",
       "vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory\r\n",
       "of herself behind.  He had thought he loved her\r\n",
       "to distraction; he had regarded his passion as adoration;\r\n",
       "and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality. \r\n",
       "He had been months winning her; she had confessed\r\n",
       "hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the\r\n",
       "proudest boy in the world only seven short days, and\r\n",
       "here in one instant of time she had gone out of his\r\n",
       "heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done. He worshipped this new angel with\r\n",
       "furtive eye, till he saw that she had discovered him;\r\n",
       "then he pretended he did not know she was present,\r\n",
       "and began to “show off” in all sorts of\r\n",
       "absurd boyish ways, in order to win her admiration. \r\n",
       "He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time;\r\n",
       "but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous\r\n",
       "gymnastic performances, he glanced aside and saw that\r\n",
       "the little girl was wending her way toward the house. \r\n",
       "Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it, grieving,\r\n",
       "and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. \r\n",
       "She halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward\r\n",
       "the door.  Tom heaved a great sigh as she put\r\n",
       "her foot on the threshold.  But his face lit up,\r\n",
       "right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a\r\n",
       "moment before she disappeared. The boy ran around and stopped within\r\n",
       "a foot or two of the flower, and then shaded his eyes\r\n",
       "with his hand and began to look down street as if\r\n",
       "he had discovered something of interest going on in\r\n",
       "that direction.  Presently he picked up a straw\r\n",
       "and began trying to balance it on his nose, with his\r\n",
       "head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to\r\n",
       "side, in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward\r\n",
       "the pansy; finally his bare foot rested upon it, his\r\n",
       "pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped away with\r\n",
       "the treasure and disappeared round the corner. \r\n",
       "But only for a minute ­only while he could\r\n",
       "button the flower inside his jacket, next his heart ­or\r\n",
       "next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted\r\n",
       "in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway. He returned, now, and hung about the\r\n",
       "fence till nightfall, “showing off,” as\r\n",
       "before; but the girl never exhibited herself again,\r\n",
       "though Tom comforted himself a little with the hope\r\n",
       "that she had been near some window, meantime, and\r\n",
       "been aware of his attentions.  Finally he strode\r\n",
       "home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions. All through supper his spirits were\r\n",
       "so high that his aunt wondered “what had got\r\n",
       "into the child.”  He took a good scolding\r\n",
       "about clodding Sid, and did not seem to mind it in\r\n",
       "the least.  He tried to steal sugar under his\r\n",
       "aunt’s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped\r\n",
       "for it.  He said:  “Aunt, you don’t whack Sid when he takes\r\n",
       "it.” “Well, Sid don’t torment\r\n",
       "a body the way you do.  You’d be always into\r\n",
       "that sugar if I warn’t watching you.” Presently she stepped into the kitchen,\r\n",
       "and Sid, happy in his immunity, reached for the sugar-bowl ­a\r\n",
       "sort of glorying over Tom which was wellnigh unbearable. \r\n",
       "But Sid’s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped\r\n",
       "and broke.  Tom was in ecstasies.  In such\r\n",
       "ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was\r\n",
       "silent.  He said to himself that he would not\r\n",
       "speak a word, even when his aunt came in, but would\r\n",
       "sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief;\r\n",
       "and then he would tell, and there would be nothing\r\n",
       "so good in the world as to see that pet model “catch\r\n",
       "it.”  He was so brimful of exultation that\r\n",
       "he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came\r\n",
       "back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings\r\n",
       "of wrath from over her spectacles.  He said to\r\n",
       "himself, “Now it’s coming!” And the\r\n",
       "next instant he was sprawling on the floor!  The\r\n",
       "potent palm was uplifted to strike again when Tom cried\r\n",
       "out:  “Hold on, now, what ’er\r\n",
       "you belting me for? ­Sid broke it!” Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and\r\n",
       "Tom looked for healing pity.  But when she got\r\n",
       "her tongue again, she only said:  “Umf!  Well, you didn’t\r\n",
       "get a lick amiss, I reckon.  You been into some\r\n",
       "other audacious mischief when I wasn’t around,\r\n",
       "like enough.” Then her conscience reproached her,\r\n",
       "and she yearned to say something kind and loving;\r\n",
       "but she judged that this would be construed into a\r\n",
       "confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline\r\n",
       "forbade that.  So she kept silence, and went about\r\n",
       "her affairs with a troubled heart.  Tom sulked\r\n",
       "in a corner and exalted his woes.  He knew that\r\n",
       "in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him, and\r\n",
       "he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of\r\n",
       "it.  He would hang out no signals, he would take\r\n",
       "notice of none.  He knew that a yearning glance\r\n",
       "fell upon him, now and then, through a film of tears,\r\n",
       "but he refused recognition of it.  He pictured\r\n",
       "himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending\r\n",
       "over him beseeching one little forgiving word, but\r\n",
       "he would turn his face to the wall, and die with that\r\n",
       "word unsaid.  Ah, how would she feel then? \r\n",
       "And he pictured himself brought home from the river,\r\n",
       "dead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at\r\n",
       "rest.  How she would throw herself upon him, and\r\n",
       "how her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray\r\n",
       "God to give her back her boy and she would never,\r\n",
       "never abuse him any more!  But he would lie there\r\n",
       "cold and white and make no sign ­a poor little\r\n",
       "sufferer, whose griefs were at an end.  He so\r\n",
       "worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these\r\n",
       "dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like\r\n",
       "to choke; and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which\r\n",
       "overflowed when he winked, and ran down and trickled\r\n",
       "from the end of his nose.  And such a luxury to\r\n",
       "him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could\r\n",
       "not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating\r\n",
       "delight intrude upon it; it was too sacred for such\r\n",
       "contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced\r\n",
       "in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after\r\n",
       "an age-long visit of one week to the country, he got\r\n",
       "up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door\r\n",
       "as she brought song and sunshine in at the other. He wandered far from the accustomed\r\n",
       "haunts of boys, and sought desolate places that were\r\n",
       "in harmony with his spirit.  A log raft in the\r\n",
       "river invited him, and he seated himself on its outer\r\n",
       "edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream,\r\n",
       "wishing, the while, that he could only be drowned,\r\n",
       "all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing\r\n",
       "the uncomfortable routine devised by nature.  Then\r\n",
       "he thought of his flower.  He got it out, rumpled\r\n",
       "and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal felicity. \r\n",
       "He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? \r\n",
       "Would she cry, and wish that she had a right to put\r\n",
       "her arms around his neck and comfort him?  Or\r\n",
       "would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world? \r\n",
       "This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable\r\n",
       "suffering that he worked it over and over again in\r\n",
       "his mind and set it up in new and varied lights, till\r\n",
       "he wore it threadbare.  At last he rose up sighing\r\n",
       "and departed in the darkness. About half-past nine or ten o’clock\r\n",
       "he came along the deserted street to where the Adored\r\n",
       "Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon\r\n",
       "his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow\r\n",
       "upon the curtain of a second-story window.  Was\r\n",
       "the sacred presence there?  He climbed the fence,\r\n",
       "threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till\r\n",
       "he stood under that window; he looked up at it long,\r\n",
       "and with emotion; then he laid him down on the ground\r\n",
       "under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his\r\n",
       "hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor\r\n",
       "wilted flower.  And thus he would die ­out\r\n",
       "in the cold world, with no shelter over his homeless\r\n",
       "head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from\r\n",
       "his brow, no loving face to bend pityingly over him\r\n",
       "when the great agony came.  And thus she would\r\n",
       "see him when she looked out upon the glad morning,\r\n",
       "and oh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor,\r\n",
       "lifeless form, would she heave one little sigh to see\r\n",
       "a bright young life so rudely blighted, so untimely\r\n",
       "cut down? The window went up, a maid-servant’s\r\n",
       "discordant voice profaned the holy calm, and a deluge\r\n",
       "of water drenched the prone martyr’s remains! The strangling hero sprang up with\r\n",
       "a relieving snort.  There was a whiz as of a missile\r\n",
       "in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound\r\n",
       "as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague\r\n",
       "form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom. Not long after, as Tom, all undressed\r\n",

       "mourn ­a ­a ­ blessed\r\n",
       "are they that shall ­they that ­a ­they\r\n",
       "that shall mourn, for they shall ­a ­shall\r\n",
       "what?  Why don’t you tell me, Mary? ­what\r\n",
       "do you want to be so mean for?” “Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed\r\n",
       "thing, I’m not teasing you.  I wouldn’t\r\n",
       "do that.  You must go and learn it again. \r\n",
       "Don’t you be discouraged, Tom, you’ll\r\n",
       "manage it ­and if you do, I’ll give\r\n",
       "you something ever so nice.  There, now, that’s\r\n",
       "a good boy.” “All right!  What is it, Mary, tell me what\r\n",
       "it is.” “Never you mind, Tom.  You know if I say\r\n",
       "it’s nice, it is nice.” “You bet you that’s so, Mary.  All\r\n",
       "right, I’ll tackle it again.” And he did “tackle it again” ­and\r\n",
       "under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective\r\n",
       "gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished\r\n",
       "a shining success.  Mary gave him a brand-new “Barlow”\r\n",
       "knife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion\r\n",
       "of delight that swept his system shook him to his\r\n",
       "foundations.  True, the knife would not cut anything,\r\n",
       "but it was a “sure-enough” Barlow, and\r\n",
       "there was inconceivable grandeur in that ­though\r\n",
       "where the Western boys ever got the idea that such\r\n",
       "a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury\r\n",
       "is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. \r\n",
       "Tom contrived to scarify the cupboard with it, and\r\n",
       "was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was\r\n",
       "called off to dress for Sunday-school. Mary gave him a tin basin of water\r\n",
       "and a piece of soap, and he went outside the door\r\n",
       "and set the basin on a little bench there; then he\r\n",
       "dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned\r\n",
       "up his sleeves; poured out the water on the ground,\r\n",
       "gently, and then entered the kitchen and began to\r\n",
       "wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. \r\n",
       "But Mary removed the towel and said:  “Now ain’t you ashamed,\r\n",
       "Tom.  You mustn’t be so bad.  Water won’t\r\n",
       "hurt you.” Tom was a trifle disconcerted. \r\n",
       "The basin was refilled, and this time he stood over\r\n",
       "it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a\r\n",
       "big breath and began.  When he entered the kitchen\r\n",
       "presently, with both eyes shut and groping for the\r\n",
       "towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of suds\r\n",
       "and water was dripping from his face.  But when\r\n",
       "he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory,\r\n",
       "for the clean territory stopped short at his chin\r\n",
       "and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line\r\n",
       "there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread\r\n",
       "downward in front and backward around his neck. \r\n",
       "Mary took him in hand, and when she was done with\r\n",
       "him he was a man and a brother, without distinction\r\n",
       "of color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed,\r\n",
       "and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical\r\n",
       "general effect. [He privately smoothed out the curls,\r\n",
       "with labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair\r\n",
       "close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate,\r\n",
       "and his own filled his life with bitterness.] Then\r\n",
       "Mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been\r\n",
       "used only on Sundays during two years ­they\r\n",
       "were simply called his “other clothes” ­and\r\n",
       "so by that we know the size of his wardrobe. \r\n",
       "The girl “put him to rights” after he had\r\n",
       "dressed himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout\r\n",
       "up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar down\r\n",
       "over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him\r\n",
       "with his speckled straw hat.  He now looked exceedingly\r\n",
       "improved and uncomfortable.  He was fully as uncomfortable\r\n",
       "as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole\r\n",
       "clothes and cleanliness that galled him.  He hoped\r\n",
       "that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was\r\n",
       "blighted; she coated them thoroughly with tallow,\r\n",
       "as was the custom, and brought them out.  He lost\r\n",
       "his temper and said he was always being made to do\r\n",
       "everything he didn’t want to do.  But Mary\r\n",
       "said, persuasively:  “Please, Tom ­that’s a good\r\n",
       "boy.” So he got into the shoes snarling. \r\n",
       "Mary was soon ready, and the three children set out\r\n",
       "for Sunday-school ­a place that Tom hated\r\n",
       "with his whole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of\r\n",
       "it. Sabbath-school hours were from nine\r\n",
       "to half-past ten; and then church service.  Two\r\n",
       "of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,\r\n",
       "and the other always remained too ­for stronger\r\n",
       "reasons.  The church’s high-backed, uncushioned\r\n",
       "pews would seat about three hundred persons; the edifice\r\n",
       "was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine\r\n",
       "board tree-box on top of it for a steeple.  At\r\n",
       "the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a Sunday-dressed\r\n",
       "comrade:  “Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?” “Yes.” “What’ll you take for her?” “What’ll you give?” “Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.” “Less see ’em.” Tom exhibited.  They were satisfactory,\r\n",
       "and the property changed hands.  Then Tom traded\r\n",
       "a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and\r\n",
       "some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. \r\n",
       "He waylaid other boys as they came, and went on buying\r\n",
       "tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer. \r\n",
       "He entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean\r\n",
       "and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and\r\n",
       "started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. \r\n",
       "The teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered; then\r\n",
       "turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy’s\r\n",
       "hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book\r\n",
       "when the boy turned around; stuck a pin in another\r\n",
       "boy, presently, in order to hear him say “Ouch!”\r\n",
       "and got a new reprimand from his teacher.  Tom’s\r\n",
       "whole class were of a pattern ­restless,\r\n",
       "noisy, and troublesome.  When they came to recite\r\n",
       "their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly,\r\n",
       "but had to be prompted all along.  However, they\r\n",
       "worried through, and each got his reward ­in\r\n",
       "small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture\r\n",
       "on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of\r\n",
       "the recitation.  Ten blue tickets equalled a red\r\n",
       "one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets\r\n",
       "equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the\r\n",
       "superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth\r\n",
       "forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil. \r\n",
       "How many of my readers would have the industry and\r\n",
       "application to memorize two thousand verses, even\r\n",
       "for a Dore Bible?  And yet Mary had acquired two\r\n",
       "Bibles in this way ­it was the patient work\r\n",
       "of two years ­and a boy of German parentage\r\n",
       "had won four or five.  He once recited three thousand\r\n",
       "verses without stopping; but the strain upon his mental\r\n",
       "faculties was too great, and he was little better\r\n",
       "than an idiot from that day forth ­a grievous\r\n",
       "misfortune for the school, for on great occasions,\r\n",
       "before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed\r\n",
       "it) had always made this boy come out and “spread\r\n",
       "himself.”  Only the older pupils managed\r\n",
       "to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work\r\n",
       "long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of\r\n",
       "one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance;\r\n",
       "the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for\r\n",
       "that day that on the spot every scholar’s heart\r\n",
       "was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted\r\n",
       "a couple of weeks.  It is possible that Tom’s\r\n",
       "mental stomach had never really hungered for one of\r\n",
       "those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being\r\n",
       "had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat\r\n",
       "that came with it. In due course the superintendent stood\r\n",
       "up in front of the pulpit, with a closed hymn-book\r\n",
       "in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its\r\n",
       "leaves, and commanded attention.  When a Sunday-school\r\n",
       "superintendent makes his customary little speech,\r\n",
       "a hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the\r\n",
       "inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer\r\n",
       "who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo\r\n",
       "at a concert  ­though why, is a mystery: \r\n",
       "for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is\r\n",
       "ever referred to by the sufferer.  This superintendent\r\n",
       "was a slim creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee\r\n",
       "and short sandy hair; he wore a stiff standing-collar\r\n",
       "whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose\r\n",
       "sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of\r\n",
       "his mouth ­a fence that compelled a straight\r\n",
       "lookout ahead, and a turning of the whole body when\r\n",
       "a side view was required; his chin was propped on\r\n",
       "a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as\r\n",
       "a bank-note, and had fringed ends; his boot toes were\r\n",
       "turned sharply up, in the fashion of the day, like\r\n",
       "sleigh-runners ­an effect patiently and\r\n",
       "laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with\r\n",
       "their toes pressed against a wall for hours together. \r\n",
       "Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very sincere\r\n",
       "and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and\r\n",
       "places in such reverence, and so separated them from\r\n",
       "worldly matters, that unconsciously to himself his\r\n",
       "Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation\r\n",
       "which was wholly absent on week-days.  He began\r\n",
       "after this fashion:  “Now, children, I want you all\r\n",
       "to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and\r\n",
       "give me all your attention for a minute or two. \r\n",
       "There  ­that is it.  That is the way\r\n",
       "good little boys and girls should do.  I see one\r\n",
       "little girl who is looking out of the window ­I\r\n",
       "am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere ­perhaps\r\n",
       "up in one of the trees making a speech to the little\r\n",
       "birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how\r\n",
       "good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean\r\n",
       "little faces assembled in a place like this, learning\r\n",
       "to do right and be good.”  And so forth\r\n",
       "and so on.  It is not necessary to set down the\r\n",
       "rest of the oration.  It was of a pattern which\r\n",
       "does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all. The latter third of the speech was\r\n",
       "marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations\r\n",
       "among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings and\r\n",
       "whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even\r\n",
       "to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like\r\n",
       "Sid and Mary.  But now every sound ceased suddenly,\r\n",
       "with the subsidence of Mr. Walters’ voice, and\r\n",
       "the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst\r\n",
       "of silent gratitude. A good part of the whispering had\r\n",
       "been occasioned by an event which was more or less\r\n",
       "rare ­the entrance of visitors:  lawyer\r\n",
       "Thatcher, accompanied by a very feeble and aged man;\r\n",
       "a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray\r\n",
       "hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter’s\r\n",
       "wife.  The lady was leading a child.  Tom had\r\n",
       "been restless and full of chafings and repinings;\r\n",
       "conscience-smitten, too ­he could not meet\r\n",
       "Amy Lawrence’s eye, he could not brook her loving\r\n",
       "gaze.  But when he saw this small new-comer his\r\n",
       "soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment.  The\r\n",
       "next moment he was “showing off” with all\r\n",
       "his might  ­cuffing boys, pulling hair,\r\n",
       "making faces ­in a word, using every art\r\n",
       "that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her\r\n",
       "applause.  His exaltation had but one alloy ­the\r\n",
       "memory of his humiliation in this angel’s garden ­and\r\n",
       "that record in sand was fast washing out, under the\r\n",
       "waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now. The visitors were given the highest\r\n",
       "seat of honor, and as soon as Mr. Walters’ speech\r\n",
       "was finished, he introduced them to the school. \r\n",
       "The middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious\r\n",
       "personage ­no less a one than the county\r\n",
       "judge ­altogether the most august creation\r\n",
       "these children had ever looked upon ­and\r\n",
       "they wondered what kind of material he was made of ­and\r\n",
       "they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid\r\n",
       "he might, too.  He was from Constantinople, twelve\r\n",
       "miles away ­so he had travelled, and seen\r\n",
       "the world ­these very eyes had looked upon\r\n",
       "the county court-house ­which was said to\r\n",
       "have a tin roof.  The awe which these reflections\r\n",
       "inspired was attested by the impressive silence and\r\n",
       "the ranks of staring eyes.  This was the great\r\n",
       "Judge Thatcher, brother of their own lawyer. \r\n",
       "Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar\r\n",
       "with the great man and be envied by the school. \r\n",
       "It would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings:  “Look at him, Jim!  He’s\r\n",
       "a going up there.  Say ­look! he’s\r\n",
       "a going to shake hands with him ­he is\r\n",
       "shaking hands with him!  By jings, don’t\r\n",
       "you wish you was Jeff?” Mr. Walters fell to “showing\r\n",
       "off,” with all sorts of official bustlings and\r\n",
       "activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging\r\n",
       "directions here, there, everywhere that he could find\r\n",
       "a target.  The librarian “showed off” ­running\r\n",
       "hither and thither with his arms full of books and\r\n",
       "making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect\r\n",
       "authority delights in.  The young lady teachers\r\n",
       "“showed off”  ­bending sweetly\r\n",
       "over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting\r\n",
       "pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting\r\n",
       "good ones lovingly.  The young gentlemen teachers\r\n",
       "“showed off” with small scoldings and\r\n",
       "other little displays of authority and fine attention\r\n",
       "to discipline ­and most of the teachers,\r\n",
       "of both sexes, found business up at the library, by\r\n",
       "the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had\r\n",
       "to be done over again two or three times (with much\r\n",
       "seeming vexation).  The little girls “showed\r\n",
       "off” in various ways, and the little boys “showed\r\n",
       "off” with such diligence that the air was thick\r\n",
       "with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. \r\n",
       "And above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic\r\n",
       "judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself\r\n",
       "in the sun of his own grandeur ­for he was\r\n",
       "“showing off,” too. There was only one thing wanting to\r\n",
       "make Mr. Walters’ ecstasy complete, and that\r\n",
       "was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a\r\n",
       "prodigy.  Several pupils had a few yellow tickets,\r\n",
       "but none had enough  ­he had been around\r\n",
       "among the star pupils inquiring.  He would have\r\n",
       "given worlds, now, to have that German lad back again\r\n",
       "with a sound mind. And now at this moment, when hope\r\n",
       "was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with nine yellow\r\n",
       "tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and\r\n",
       "demanded a Bible.  This was a thunderbolt out of\r\n",
       "a clear sky.  Walters was not expecting an application\r\n",
       "from this source for the next ten years.  But\r\n",
       "there was no getting around it ­here were\r\n",
       "the certified checks, and they were good for their\r\n",
       "face.  Tom was therefore elevated to a place with\r\n",
       "the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was\r\n",
       "announced from headquarters.  It was the most stunning\r\n",
       "surprise of the decade, and so profound was the sensation\r\n",
       "that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one’s\r\n",
       "altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon\r\n",
       "in place of one.  The boys were all eaten up with\r\n",
       "envy ­but those that suffered the bitterest\r\n",
       "pangs were those who perceived too late that they\r\n",
       "themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by\r\n",
       "trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed\r\n",
       "in selling whitewashing privileges.  These despised\r\n",
       "themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a\r\n",
       "guileful snake in the grass. The prize was delivered to Tom with\r\n",
       "as much effusion as the superintendent could pump\r\n",
       "up under the circumstances; but it lacked somewhat\r\n",
       "of the true gush, for the poor fellow’s instinct\r\n",
       "taught him that there was a mystery here that could\r\n",
       "not well bear the light, perhaps; it was simply preposterous\r\n",
       "that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves\r\n",
       "of Scriptural wisdom on his premises ­a dozen\r\n",
       "would strain his capacity, without a doubt. Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and\r\n",
       "she tried to make Tom see it in her face ­but\r\n",
       "he wouldn’t look.  She wondered; then she\r\n",
       "was just a grain troubled; next a dim suspicion came\r\n",
       "and went ­came again; she watched; a furtive\r\n",
       "glance told her worlds ­and then her heart\r\n",
       "broke, and she was jealous, and angry, and the tears\r\n",
       "came and she hated everybody.  Tom most of all\r\n",
       "(she thought). Tom was introduced to the Judge; but\r\n",
       "his tongue was tied, his breath would hardly come,\r\n",
       "his heart quaked ­partly because of the awful\r\n",
       "greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her\r\n",
       "parent.  He would have liked to fall down and\r\n",
       "worship him, if it were in the dark.  The Judge\r\n",
       "put his hand on Tom’s head and called him a fine\r\n",
       "little man, and asked him what his name was. \r\n",
       "The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:  “Tom.” “Oh, no, not Tom ­it is ­” “Thomas.” “Ah, that’s it.  I\r\n",
       "thought there was more to it, maybe.  That’s\r\n",
       "very well.  But you’ve another one I daresay,\r\n",

       "name, Thomas,” said Walters, “and say\r\n",
       "sir.  You mustn’t forget your manners.” “Thomas Sawyer ­sir.” “That’s it!  That’s\r\n",
       "a good boy.  Fine boy.  Fine, manly little\r\n",
       "fellow.  Two thousand verses is a great many ­very,\r\n",
       "very great many.  And you never can be sorry for\r\n",
       "the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge\r\n",
       "is worth more than anything there is in the world;\r\n",
       "it’s what makes great men and good men; you’ll\r\n",
       "be a great man and a good man yourself, some day,\r\n",
       "Thomas, and then you’ll look back and say, It’s\r\n",
       "all owing to the precious Sunday-school privileges\r\n",
       "of my boyhood ­it’s all owing to my\r\n",
       "dear teachers that taught me to learn ­it’s\r\n",
       "all owing to the good superintendent, who encouraged\r\n",
       "me, and watched over me, and gave me a beautiful Bible ­a\r\n",
       "splendid elegant Bible ­to keep and have\r\n",
       "it all for my own, always ­it’s all\r\n",
       "owing to right bringing up!  That is what you\r\n",
       "will say, Thomas ­and you wouldn’t\r\n",
       "take any money for those two thousand verses ­no\r\n",
       "indeed you wouldn’t.  And now you wouldn’t\r\n",
       "mind telling me and this lady some of the things you’ve\r\n",
       "learned ­no, I know you wouldn’t ­for\r\n",
       "we are proud of little boys that learn.  Now, no\r\n",
       "doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples. \r\n",
       "Won’t you tell us the names of the first two\r\n",
       "that were appointed?” Tom was tugging at a button-hole and\r\n",
       "looking sheepish.  He blushed, now, and his eyes\r\n",
       "fell.  Mr. Walters’ heart sank within him. \r\n",
       "He said to himself, it is not possible that the boy\r\n",
       "can answer the simplest question ­why did\r\n",
       "the Judge ask him?  Yet he felt obliged to speak\r\n",
       "up and say:  “Answer the gentleman, Thomas ­don’t\r\n",
       "be afraid.” Tom still hung fire. “Now I know you’ll tell\r\n",
       "me,” said the lady.  “The names of\r\n",
       "the first two disciples were ­” “David and GOLIAH!” Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of\r\n",
       "the scene. |\n",
       "| 5 | About half-past ten the cracked\r\n",
       "bell of the small church began to ring, and presently\r\n",
       "the people began to gather for the morning sermon. \r\n",
       "The Sunday-school children distributed themselves about\r\n",
       "the house and occupied pews with their parents, so\r\n",
       "as to be under supervision.  Aunt Polly came,\r\n",
       "and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her ­Tom\r\n",
       "being placed next the aisle, in order that he might\r\n",
       "be as far away from the open window and the seductive\r\n",
       "outside summer scenes as possible.  The crowd\r\n",
       "filed up the aisles:  the aged and needy postmaster,\r\n",
       "who had seen better days; the mayor and his wife ­for\r\n",
       "they had a mayor there, among other unnecessaries;\r\n",
       "the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair,\r\n",
       "smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and\r\n",
       "well-to-do, her hill mansion the only palace in the\r\n",
       "town, and the most hospitable and much the most lavish\r\n",
       "in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could\r\n",
       "boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward;\r\n",
       "lawyer Riverson, the new notable from a distance;\r\n",
       "next the belle of the village, followed by a troop\r\n",
       "of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers;\r\n",
       "then all the young clerks in town in a body ­for\r\n",
       "they had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane-heads,\r\n",
       "a circling wall of oiled and simpering admirers, till\r\n",
       "the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all\r\n",
       "came the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful\r\n",
       "care of his mother as if she were cut glass.  He\r\n",
       "always brought his mother to church, and was the pride\r\n",
       "of all the matrons.  The boys all hated him, he\r\n",
       "was so good.  And besides, he had been “thrown\r\n",
       "up to them” so much.  His white handkerchief\r\n",
       "was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on\r\n",
       "Sundays ­accidentally.  Tom had no handkerchief,\r\n",
       "and he looked upon boys who had as snobs. The congregation being fully assembled,\r\n",
       "now, the bell rang once more, to warn laggards and\r\n",
       "stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the church\r\n",
       "which was only broken by the tittering and whispering\r\n",
       "of the choir in the gallery.  The choir always\r\n",
       "tittered and whispered all through service.  There\r\n",
       "was once a church choir that was not ill-bred, but\r\n",
       "I have forgotten where it was, now.  It was a great\r\n",
       "many years ago, and I can scarcely remember anything\r\n",
       "about it, but I think it was in some foreign country. The minister gave out the hymn, and\r\n",
       "read it through with a relish, in a peculiar style\r\n",
       "which was much admired in that part of the country. \r\n",
       "His voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily\r\n",
       "up till it reached a certain point, where it bore\r\n",
       "with strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then\r\n",
       "plunged down as if from a spring-board:    Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on\r\n",
       "flow’ry beds of ease,   Whilst others fight to win the prize,\r\n",
       "and sail thro’ bloody seas? He was regarded as a wonderful reader. \r\n",
       "At church “sociables” he was always\r\n",
       "called upon to read poetry; and when he was through,\r\n",
       "the ladies would lift up their hands and let them\r\n",
       "fall helplessly in their laps, and “wall”\r\n",
       "their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say,\r\n",
       "“Words cannot express it; it is too beautiful,\r\n",
       "too beautiful for this mortal earth.” After the hymn had been sung, the\r\n",
       "Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into a bulletin-board,\r\n",
       "and read off “notices” of meetings and\r\n",
       "societies and things till it seemed that the list\r\n",
       "would stretch out to the crack of doom ­a\r\n",
       "queer custom which is still kept up in America, even\r\n",
       "in cities, away here in this age of abundant newspapers. \r\n",
       "Often, the less there is to justify a traditional\r\n",
       "custom, the harder it is to get rid of it. And now the minister prayed. \r\n",
       "A good, generous prayer it was, and went into details: \r\n",
       "it pleaded for the church, and the little children\r\n",
       "of the church; for the other churches of the village;\r\n",
       "for the village itself; for the county; for the State;\r\n",
       "for the State officers; for the United States; for\r\n",
       "the churches of the United States; for Congress; for\r\n",
       "the President; for the officers of the Government;\r\n",
       "for poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for the oppressed\r\n",
       "millions groaning under the heel of European monarchies\r\n",
       "and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light\r\n",
       "and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see\r\n",
       "nor ears to hear withal; for the heathen in the far\r\n",
       "islands of the sea; and closed with a supplication\r\n",
       "that the words he was about to speak might find grace\r\n",
       "and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding\r\n",
       "in time a grateful harvest of good.  Amen. There was a rustling of dresses, and\r\n",
       "the standing congregation sat down.  The boy whose\r\n",
       "history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer,\r\n",
       "he only endured it ­if he even did that much. \r\n",
       "He was restive all through it; he kept tally of the\r\n",
       "details of the prayer, unconsciously  ­for\r\n",
       "he was not listening, but he knew the ground of old,\r\n",
       "and the clergyman’s regular route over it ­and\r\n",
       "when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,\r\n",
       "his ear detected it and his whole nature resented\r\n",
       "it; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. \r\n",
       "In the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back\r\n",
       "of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit\r\n",
       "by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its\r\n",
       "head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously\r\n",
       "that it seemed to almost part company with the body,\r\n",
       "and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view;\r\n",
       "scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing\r\n",
       "them to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going\r\n",
       "through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew\r\n",
       "it was perfectly safe.  As indeed it was; for\r\n",
       "as sorely as Tom’s hands itched to grab for\r\n",
       "it they did not dare ­he believed his soul\r\n",
       "would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing\r\n",
       "while the prayer was going on.  But with the closing\r\n",
       "sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward;\r\n",
       "and the instant the “Amen” was out the\r\n",
       "fly was a prisoner of war.  His aunt detected\r\n",
       "the act and made him let it go. The minister gave out his text and\r\n",
       "droned along monotonously through an argument that\r\n",
       "was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod\r\n",
       " ­and yet it was an argument that dealt in\r\n",
       "limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined\r\n",
       "elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth\r\n",
       "the saving.  Tom counted the pages of the sermon;\r\n",
       "after church he always knew how many pages there had\r\n",
       "been, but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse. \r\n",
       "However, this time he was really interested for a\r\n",
       "little while.  The minister made a grand and moving\r\n",
       "picture of the assembling together of the world’s\r\n",
       "hosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb\r\n",
       "should lie down together and a little child should\r\n",
       "lead them.  But the pathos, the lesson, the moral\r\n",
       "of the great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he\r\n",
       "only thought of the conspicuousness of the principal\r\n",
       "character before the on-looking nations; his face\r\n",
       "lit with the thought, and he said to himself that he\r\n",
       "wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion. Now he lapsed into suffering again,\r\n",
       "as the dry argument was resumed.  Presently he\r\n",
       "bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. \r\n",
       "It was a large black beetle with formidable jaws ­a\r\n",
       "“pinchbug,” he called it.  It was\r\n",
       "in a percussion-cap box.  The first thing the beetle\r\n",
       "did was to take him by the finger.  A natural\r\n",
       "fillip followed, the beetle went floundering into\r\n",
       "the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger\r\n",
       "went into the boy’s mouth.  The beetle lay\r\n",
       "there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over. \r\n",
       "Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out\r\n",
       "of his reach.  Other people uninterested in the\r\n",
       "sermon found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it\r\n",
       "too.  Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling\r\n",
       "along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness\r\n",
       "and the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. \r\n",
       "He spied the beetle; the drooping tail lifted and\r\n",
       "wagged.  He surveyed the prize; walked around\r\n",
       "it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around\r\n",
       "it again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then\r\n",
       "lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just\r\n",
       "missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy\r\n",
       "the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle\r\n",
       "between his paws, and continued his experiments; grew\r\n",
       "weary at last, and then indifferent and absent-minded. \r\n",
       "His head nodded, and little by little his chin descended\r\n",
       "and touched the enemy, who seized it.  There was\r\n",
       "a sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle’s head, and\r\n",
       "the beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit on\r\n",
       "its back once more.  The neighboring spectators\r\n",
       "shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went\r\n",
       "behind fans and handkerchiefs, and Tom was entirely\r\n",
       "happy.  The dog looked foolish, and probably felt\r\n",
       "so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and\r\n",
       "a craving for revenge.  So he went to the beetle\r\n",
       "and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it\r\n",
       "from every point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws\r\n",
       "within an inch of the creature, making even closer\r\n",
       "snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head\r\n",
       "till his ears flapped again.  But he grew tired\r\n",
       "once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with\r\n",
       "a fly but found no relief; followed an ant around,\r\n",
       "with his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied\r\n",
       "of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely,\r\n",
       "and sat down on it.  Then there was a wild yelp\r\n",
       "of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle;\r\n",
       "the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed\r\n",
       "the house in front of the altar; he flew down the\r\n",
       "other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored\r\n",
       "up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress,\r\n",
       "till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in\r\n",
       "its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light. \r\n",
       "At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course,\r\n",
       "and sprang into its master’s lap; he flung it\r\n",
       "out of the window, and the voice of distress quickly\r\n",
       "thinned away and died in the distance. By this time the whole church was\r\n",
       "red-faced and suffocating with suppressed laughter,\r\n",
       "and the sermon had come to a dead standstill. \r\n",
       "The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame\r\n",
       "and halting, all possibility of impressiveness being\r\n",
       "at an end; for even the gravest sentiments were constantly\r\n",
       "being received with a smothered burst of unholy mirth,\r\n",
       "under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor\r\n",
       "parson had said a rarely facetious thing.  It was\r\n",
       "a genuine relief to the whole congregation when the\r\n",
       "ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced. Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful,\r\n",
       "thinking to himself that there was some satisfaction\r\n",
       "about divine service when there was a bit of variety\r\n",
       "in it.  He had but one marring thought; he was\r\n",
       "willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug,\r\n",
       "but he did not think it was upright in him to carry\r\n",
       "it off.

       "it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court\r\n",
       "with that argument, his aunt would pull it out, and\r\n",
       "that would hurt.  So he thought he would hold\r\n",
       "the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further. \r\n",
       "Nothing offered for some little time, and then he\r\n",
       "remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain\r\n",
       "thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks\r\n",
       "and threatened to make him lose a finger.  So\r\n",
       "the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet\r\n",
       "and held it up for inspection.  But now he did\r\n",
       "not know the necessary symptoms.  However, it\r\n",
       "seemed well worth while to chance it, so he fell to\r\n",
       "groaning with considerable spirit. But Sid slept on unconscious. Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel\r\n",
       "pain in the toe. No result from Sid. Tom was panting with his exertions\r\n",
       "by this time.  He took a rest and then swelled\r\n",
       "himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans. Sid snored on. Tom was aggravated.  He said,\r\n",
       "“Sid, Sid!” and shook him.  This course\r\n",
       "worked well, and Tom began to groan again.  Sid\r\n",
       "yawned, stretched, then brought himself up on his\r\n",
       "elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom. \r\n",
       "Tom went on groaning.  Sid said:  “Tom!  Say, Tom!”\r\n",
       "[No response.] “Here, Tom!  Tom! \r\n",
       "What is the matter, Tom?” And he shook him and\r\n",
       "looked in his face anxiously. Tom moaned out:  “Oh, don’t, Sid.  Don’t joggle\r\n",
       "me.” “Why, what’s the matter, Tom?  I must\r\n",
       "call auntie.” “No ­never mind.  It’ll\r\n",
       "be over by and by, maybe.  Don’t call anybody.” “But I must!  Don’t\r\n",
       "groan so, Tom, it’s awful.  How long you\r\n",
       "been this way?” “Hours.  Ouch!  Oh, don’t stir\r\n",
       "so, Sid, you’ll kill me.” “Tom, why didn’t you wake\r\n",
       "me sooner?  Oh, Tom, don’t!  It\r\n",
       "makes my flesh crawl to hear you.  Tom, what is\r\n",
       "the matter?” “I forgive you everything, Sid.\r\n",
       "[Groan.] Everything you’ve ever done to me. \r\n",
       "When I’m gone ­” “Oh, Tom, you ain’t dying,\r\n",
       "are you?  Don’t, Tom ­oh, don’t. \r\n",
       "Maybe ­” “I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.]\r\n",
       "Tell ’em so, Sid.  And Sid, you give my\r\n",
       "window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl\r\n",
       "that’s come to town, and tell her ­” But Sid had snatched his clothes and\r\n",
       "gone.  Tom was suffering in reality, now, so handsomely\r\n",
       "was his imagination working, and so his groans had\r\n",
       "gathered quite a genuine tone. Sid flew down-stairs and said:  “Oh, Aunt Polly, come!  Tom’s dying!” “Dying!” “Yes’m.  Don’t wait ­come\r\n",
       "quick!” “Rubbage!  I don’t believe it!” But she fled up-stairs, nevertheless,\r\n",
       "with Sid and Mary at her heels.  And her face\r\n",
       "grew white, too, and her lip trembled.  When she\r\n",
       "reached the bedside she gasped out:  “You, Tom!  Tom, what’s the matter\r\n",
       "with you?” “Oh, auntie, I’m ­” “What’s the matter with you ­what\r\n",
       "is the matter with you, child?” “Oh, auntie, my sore toe’s mortified!” The old lady sank down into a chair\r\n",
       "and laughed a little, then cried a little, then did\r\n",
       "both together.  This restored her and she said:  “Tom, what a turn you did give\r\n",
       "me.  Now you shut up that nonsense and climb out\r\n",
       "of this.” The groans ceased and the pain vanished\r\n",
       "from the toe.  The boy felt a little foolish,\r\n",
       "and he said:  “Aunt Polly, it seemed\r\n",
       "mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my tooth\r\n",
       "at all.” “Your tooth, indeed!  What’s the matter\r\n",
       "with your tooth?” “One of them’s loose, and it aches perfectly\r\n",
       "awful.” “There, there, now, don’t\r\n",
       "begin that groaning again.  Open your mouth. \r\n",
       "Well ­your tooth is loose, but you’re\r\n",
       "not going to die about that.  Mary, get me a silk\r\n",
       "thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.” Tom said:  “Oh, please, auntie, don’t\r\n",
       "pull it out.  It don’t hurt any more. \r\n",
       "I wish I may never stir if it does.  Please don’t,\r\n",
       "auntie.  I don’t want to stay home from\r\n",
       "school.” “Oh, you don’t, don’t\r\n",
       "you?  So all this row was because you thought\r\n",
       "you’d get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? \r\n",
       "Tom, Tom, I love you so, and you seem to try every\r\n",
       "way you can to break my old heart with your outrageousness.” \r\n",
       "By this time the dental instruments were ready. \r\n",
       "The old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to\r\n",
       "Tom’s tooth with a loop and tied the other to\r\n",
       "the bedpost.  Then she seized the chunk of fire\r\n",
       "and suddenly thrust it almost into the boy’s\r\n",
       "face.  The tooth hung dangling by the bedpost,\r\n",
       "now. But all trials bring their compensations. \r\n",
       "As Tom wended to school after breakfast, he was the\r\n",
       "envy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper\r\n",
       "row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and\r\n",
       "admirable way.  He gathered quite a following of\r\n",
       "lads interested in the exhibition; and one that had\r\n",
       "cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination\r\n",
       "and homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly\r\n",
       "without an adherent, and shorn of his glory.  His\r\n",
       "heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain which\r\n",
       "he did not feel that it wasn’t anything to spit\r\n",
       "like Tom Sawyer; but another boy said, “Sour\r\n",
       "grapes!” and he wandered away a dismantled hero. Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile\r\n",
       "pariah of the village, Huckleberry Finn, son of the\r\n",
       "town drunkard.  Huckleberry was cordially hated\r\n",
       "and dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because\r\n",
       "he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad ­and\r\n",
       "because all their children admired him so, and delighted\r\n",
       "in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to\r\n",
       "be like him.  Tom was like the rest of the respectable\r\n",
       "boys, in that he envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast\r\n",
       "condition, and was under strict orders not to play\r\n",
       "with him.  So he played with him every time he\r\n",
       "got a chance.  Huckleberry was always dressed\r\n",
       "in the cast-off clothes of full-grown men, and they\r\n",
       "were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. \r\n",
       "His hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped\r\n",
       "out of its brim; his coat, when he wore one, hung\r\n",
       "nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far\r\n",
       "down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers;\r\n",
       "the seat of the trousers bagged low and contained\r\n",
       "nothing, the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when\r\n",
       "not rolled up. Huckleberry came and went, at his\r\n",
       "own free will.  He slept on doorsteps in fine\r\n",
       "weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have\r\n",
       "to go to school or to church, or call any being master\r\n",
       "or obey anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when\r\n",
       "and where he chose, and stay as long as it suited\r\n",
       "him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as\r\n",
       "late as he pleased; he was always the first boy that\r\n",
       "went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume\r\n",
       "leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put\r\n",
       "on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. \r\n",
       "In a word, everything that goes to make life precious\r\n",
       "that boy had.  So thought every harassed, hampered,\r\n",
       "respectable boy in St. Petersburg. Tom hailed the romantic outcast:  “Hello, Huckleberry!” “Hello yourself, and see how you like it.” “What’s that you got?” “Dead cat.” “Lemme see him, Huck.  My, he’s pretty\r\n",
       "stiff.  Where’d you get him?” “Bought him off’n a boy.” “What did you give?” “I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got\r\n",
       "at the slaughter-house.” “Where’d you get the blue ticket?” “Bought it off’n Ben Rogers two weeks\r\n",
       "ago for a hoop-stick.” “Say ­what is dead cats good for,\r\n",
       "Huck?” “Good for?  Cure warts with.” “No!  Is that so?  I know something\r\n",
       "that’s better.” “I bet you don’t.  What is it?” “Why, spunk-water.” “Spunk-water!  I wouldn’t give a dern\r\n",
       "for spunk-water.” “You wouldn’t, wouldn’t you? \r\n",
       "D’you ever try it?” “No, I hain’t.  But Bob Tanner did.” “Who told you so!” “Why, he told Jeff Thatcher,\r\n",
       "and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny told Jim Hollis,\r\n",
       "and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and\r\n",
       "the nigger told me.  There now!” “Well, what of it?  They’ll\r\n",
       "all lie.  Leastways all but the nigger.  I\r\n",
       "don’t know him.  But I never see a nigger\r\n",
       "that wouldn’t lie.  Shucks!  Now\r\n",
       "you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.” “Why, he took and dipped his\r\n",
       "hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water was.” “In the daytime?” “Certainly.” “With his face to the stump?” “Yes.  Least I reckon so.” “Did he say anything?” “I don’t reckon he did.  I don’t\r\n",
       "know.” “Aha!  Talk about trying\r\n",
       "to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool way\r\n",
       "as that!  Why, that ain’t a-going to do any\r\n",
       "good.  You got to go all by yourself, to the middle\r\n",
       "of the woods, where you know there’s a spunk-water\r\n",
       "stump, and just as it’s midnight you back up\r\n",
       "against the stump and jam your hand in and say:    ’Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal\r\n",
       "shorts,\r\n",
       "   Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller\r\n",
       "these warts,’ and then walk away quick, eleven steps,\r\n",
       "with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times\r\n",
       "and walk home without speaking to anybody.  Because\r\n",
       "if you speak the charm’s busted.” “Well, that sounds like a good\r\n",
       "way; but that ain’t the way Bob Tanner done.” “No, sir, you can bet he didn’t,\r\n",
       "becuz he’s the wartiest boy in this town; and\r\n",
       "he wouldn’t have a wart on him if he’d\r\n",
       "knowed how to work spunk-water.  I’ve took\r\n",
       "off thousands of warts off of my hands that way, Huck. \r\n",
       "I play with frogs so much that I’ve always got\r\n",
       "considerable many warts.  Sometimes I take ’em\r\n",
       "off with a bean.” “Yes, bean’s good.  I’ve done\r\n",
       "that.” “Have you?  What’s your way?” “You take and split the bean,\r\n",
       "and cut the wart so as to get some blood, and then\r\n",
       "you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take\r\n",
       "and dig a hole and bury it ’bout midnight at\r\n",
       "the crossroads in the dark of the moon, and then you\r\n",
       "burn up the rest of the bean.  You see that piece\r\n",
       "that’s got the blood on it will keep drawing\r\n",
       "and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it,\r\n",
       "and so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and\r\n",
       "pretty soon off she comes.” “Yes, that’s it, Huck ­that’s\r\n",
       "it; though when you’re burying it if you say\r\n",
       "‘Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother\r\n",
       "me!’ it’s better.  That’s the\r\n",
       "way Joe Harper does, and he’s been nearly to\r\n",
       "Coonville and most everywheres.  But say ­how\r\n",
       "do you cure ’em with dead cats?” “Why, you take your cat and\r\n",
       "go and get in the graveyard ’long about midnight\r\n",
       "when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and\r\n",
       "when it’s midnight a devil will come, or maybe\r\n",
       "two or three, but you can’t see ’em, you\r\n",
       "can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear\r\n",
       "’em talk; and when they’re taking that\r\n",
       "feller away, you heave your cat after ’em and\r\n",
       "say, ’Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil,\r\n",
       "warts follow cat, I’m done with ye!’ That’ll\r\n",
       "fetch any wart.” “Sounds right.  D’you ever try it,\r\n",
       "Huck?” “No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.” “Well, I reckon it’s so, then.  Becuz\r\n",
       "they say she’s a witch.” “Say!  Why, Tom, I know\r\n",
       "she is.  She witched pap.  Pap says so his\r\n",
       "own self.  He come along one day, and he see she\r\n",
       "was a-witching him, so he took up a rock, and if she\r\n",
       "hadn’t dodged, he’d a got her.  Well,\r\n",
       "that very night he rolled off’n a shed wher’\r\n",
       "he was a layin drunk, and broke his arm.” “Why, that’s awful.  How did he know\r\n",
       "she was a-witching him?” “Lord, pap can tell, easy. \r\n",
       "Pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy,\r\n",
       "they’re a-witching you.  Specially if they\r\n",
       "mumble.  Becuz when they mumble they’re\r\n",
       "saying the Lord’s Prayer backards.” “Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?” “To-night.  I reckon they’ll come\r\n",
       "after old Hoss Williams to-night.” “But they buried him Saturday.  Didn’t\r\n",
       "they get him Saturday night?” “Why, how you talk!  How\r\n",
       "could their charms work till midnight? ­and\r\n",
       "then it’s Sunday.  Devils don’t\r\n",
       "slosh around much of a Sunday, I don’t reckon.” “I never thought of that.  That’s\r\n",
       "so.  Lemme go with you?” “Of course ­if you ain’t afeard.” “Afeard!  ’Tain’t likely. \r\n",
       "Will you meow?” “Yes ­and you meow\r\n",
       "back, if you get a chance.  Last time, you kep’\r\n",
       "me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing\r\n",
       "rocks at me and says ‘Dern that cat!’\r\n",
       "and so I hove a brick through his window ­but\r\n",
       "don’t you tell.” “I won’t.  I couldn’t\r\n",
       "meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but\r\n",
       "I’ll meow this time.  Say ­what’s\r\n",
       "that?” “Nothing but a tick.” “Where’d you get him?” “Out in the woods.” “What’ll you take for him?” “I don’t know.  I don’t want\r\n",
       "to sell him.” “All right.  It’s a mighty small tick,\r\n",
       "anyway.” “Oh, anybody can run a tick\r\n",
       "down that don’t belong to them.  I’m\r\n",
       "satisfied with it.  It’s a good enough tick\r\n",
       "for me.” “Sho, there’s ticks a\r\n",
       "plenty.  I could have a thousand of ’em if\r\n",
       "I wanted to.” “Well, why don’t you? \r\n",
       "Becuz you know mighty well you can’t.  This\r\n",
       "is a pretty early tick, I reckon.  It’s\r\n",
       "the first one I’ve seen this year.” “Say, Huck ­I’ll give you my\r\n",
       "tooth for him.” “Less see it.” Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully\r\n",
       "unrolled it.  Huckleberry viewed it wistfully. \r\n",
       "The temptation was very strong.  At last he said:  “Is it genuwyne?” Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy. “Well, all right,” said Huckleberry, “it’s\r\n",
       "a trade.” Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap\r\n",
       "box that had lately been the pinchbug’s prison,\r\n",
       "and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than\r\n",
       "before. When Tom reached the little isolated\r\n",
       "frame schoolhouse, he strode in briskly, with the\r\n",
       "manner of one who had come with all honest speed. \r\n",
       "He hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his\r\n",
       "seat with business-like alacrity.  The master,\r\n",
       "throned on high in his great splint-bottom arm-chair,\r\n",
       "was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. \r\n",
       "The interruption roused him. “Thomas Sawyer!” Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full,\r\n",
       "it meant trouble. “Sir!” “Come up here.  Now, sir, why are you late\r\n",
       "again, as usual?” Tom was about to take refuge in a\r\n",
       "lie, when he saw two long tails of yellow hair hanging\r\n",
       "down a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy\r\n",
       "of love; and by that form was the only vacant\r\n",
       "place on the girls’ side of the schoolhouse. \r\n",
       "He instantly said:  “I stopped to talk with\r\n",
       "Huckleberry Finn!” The master’s pulse stood still,\r\n",
       "and he stared helplessly.  The buzz of study ceased. \r\n",
       "The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost\r\n",
       "his mind.  The master said:  “You ­you did what?” “Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.” There was no mistaking the words. “Thomas Sawyer, this is the\r\n",
       "most astounding confession I have ever listened to. \r\n",
       "No mere ferule will answer for this offence.  Take\r\n",
       "off your jacket.” The master’s arm performed until\r\n",
       "it was tired and the stock of switches notably diminished. \r\n",
       "Then the order followed:  “Now, sir, go and sit with the girls!  And\r\n",
       "let this be a warning to you.” The titter that rippled around the\r\n",
       "room appeared to abash the boy, but in reality that\r\n",
       "result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe\r\n",
       "of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay\r\n",
       "in his high good fortune.  He sat down upon the\r\n",
       "end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself\r\n",
       "away from him with a toss of her head.  Nudges\r\n",
       "and winks and whispers traversed the room, but Tom\r\n",
       "sat still, with his arms upon the long, low desk before\r\n",
       "him, and seemed to study his book. By and by attention ceased from him,\r\n",
       "and the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull\r\n",
       "air once more.  Presently the boy began to steal\r\n",
       "furtive glances at the girl.  She observed it,\r\n",
       "“made a mouth” at him and gave him the\r\n",
       "back of her head for the space of a minute.  When\r\n",
       "she cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before\r\n",
       "her.  She thrust it away.  Tom gently put\r\n",
       "it back.  She thrust it away again, but with less\r\n",
       "animosity.  Tom patiently returned it to its place. \r\n",
       "Then she let it remain.  Tom scrawled on his slate,\r\n",
       "“Please take it ­I got more.” \r\n",
       "The girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. \r\n",
       "Now the boy began to draw something on the slate,\r\n",
       "hiding his work with his left hand.  For a time\r\n",
       "the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity\r\n",
       "presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible\r\n",
       "signs.  The boy worked on, apparently unconscious. \r\n",
       "The girl made a sort of noncommittal attempt to see,\r\n",

       "At last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered:  “Let me see it.” Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature\r\n",
       "of a house with two gable ends to it and a corkscrew\r\n",
       "of smoke issuing from the chimney.  Then the girl’s\r\n",
       "interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she\r\n",
       "forgot everything else.  When it was finished,\r\n",
       "she gazed a moment, then whispered:  “It’s nice ­make a man.” The artist erected a man in the front\r\n",
       "yard, that resembled a derrick.  He could have\r\n",
       "stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;\r\n",
       "she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:  “It’s a beautiful man ­now make\r\n",
       "me coming along.” Tom drew an hour-glass with a full\r\n",
       "moon and straw limbs to it and armed the spreading\r\n",
       "fingers with a portentous fan.  The girl said:  “It’s ever so nice ­I wish I\r\n",
       "could draw.” “It’s easy,” whispered Tom, “I’ll\r\n",
       "learn you.” “Oh, will you?  When?” “At noon.  Do you go home to dinner?” “I’ll stay if you will.” “Good ­that’s a whack. \r\n",
       "What’s your name?” “Becky Thatcher.  What’s yours? \r\n",
       "Oh, I know.  It’s Thomas Sawyer.” “That’s the name they\r\n",
       "lick me by.  I’m Tom when I’m good. \r\n",
       "You call me Tom, will you?” “Yes.” Now Tom began to scrawl something\r\n",
       "on the slate, hiding the words from the girl. \r\n",
       "But she was not backward this time.  She begged\r\n",

       "let me.” “Oh, you don’t want to see!” “Now that you treat me so, I\r\n",
       "will see.”  And she put her small hand\r\n",
       "upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending\r\n",
       "to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by\r\n",
       "degrees till these words were revealed:  “I\r\n",
       "love you.” “Oh, you bad thing!” And\r\n",
       "she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and looked\r\n",
       "pleased, nevertheless. Just at this juncture the boy felt\r\n",
       "a slow, fateful grip closing on his ear, and a steady\r\n",
       "lifting impulse.  In that wise he was borne across\r\n",
       "the house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering\r\n",
       "fire of giggles from the whole school.  Then the\r\n",
       "master stood over him during a few awful moments,\r\n",
       "and finally moved away to his throne without saying\r\n",
       "a word.  But although Tom’s ear tingled,\r\n",
       "his heart was jubilant. As the school quieted down Tom made\r\n",
       "an honest effort to study, but the turmoil within\r\n",
       "him was too great.  In turn he took his place in\r\n",
       "the reading class and made a botch of it; then in\r\n",
       "the geography class and turned lakes into mountains,\r\n",
       "mountains into rivers, and rivers into continents,\r\n",

       "1 “Tom!” No answer. “Tom!” No answer. “What’s gone with that boy,  I wonder? \\r\\nYou Tom!” No answer. The old lady pulled her spectacles\\r\\ndown and looked over them about the room; then she\\r\\nput them up and looked out under them.  She seldom\\r\\nor never looked through them for so small a thing\\r\\nas a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her\\r\\nheart, and were built for “style,” not\\r\\nservice ­she could have seen through a pair\\r\\nof stove-lids just as well.  She looked perplexed\\r\\nfor a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still\\r\\nloud enough for the furniture to hear:  “Well, I lay if I get hold of you I’ll ­” She did not finish, for by this time\\r\\nshe was bending down and punching under the bed with\\r\\nthe broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the\\r\\npunches with.  She resurrected nothing but the\\r\\ncat. “I never did see the beat of that boy!” She went to the open door and stood\\r\\nin it and looked out among the tomato vines and “jimpson”\\r\\nweeds that constituted the garden.  No Tom. \\r\\nSo she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for\\r\\ndistance and shouted:  “Y-o-u-u Tom!” There was a slight noise behind her\\r\\nand she turned just in time to seize a small boy by\\r\\nthe slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight. “There!  I might ‘a’\\r\\nthought of that closet.  What you been doing in\\r\\nthere?” “Nothing.” “Nothing!  Look at your\\r\\nhands.  And look at your mouth.  What is\\r\\nthat truck?” “I don’t know, aunt.” “Well, I know.  It’s\\r\\njam ­that’s what it is.  Forty\\r\\ntimes I’ve said if you didn’t let that\\r\\njam alone I’d skin you.  Hand me that switch.” The switch hovered in the air ­the peril\\r\\nwas desperate ­ “My!  Look behind you, aunt!” The old lady whirled round, and snatched\\r\\nher skirts out of danger.  The lad fled on the\\r\\ninstant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and disappeared\\r\\nover it. His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment,\\r\\nand then broke into a gentle laugh. “Hang the boy, can’t I\\r\\nnever learn anything?  Ain’t he played me\\r\\ntricks enough like that for me to be looking out for\\r\\nhim by this time?  But old fools is the biggest\\r\\nfools there is.  Can’t learn an old dog new\\r\\ntricks, as the saying is.  But my goodness, he\\r\\nnever plays them alike, two days, and how is a body\\r\\nto know what’s coming?  He ’pears to\\r\\nknow just how long he can torment me before I get\\r\\nmy dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put\\r\\nme off for a minute or make me laugh, it’s all\\r\\ndown again and I can’t hit him a lick. \\r\\nI ain’t doing my duty by that boy, and that’s\\r\\nthe Lord’s truth, goodness knows.  Spare\\r\\nthe rod and spile the child, as the Good Book says. \\r\\nI’m a laying up sin and suffering for us both,\\r\\nI know.  He’s full of the Old Scratch, but\\r\\nlaws-a-me! he’s my own dead sister’s boy,\\r\\npoor thing, and I ain’t got the heart to lash\\r\\nhim, somehow.  Every time I let him off, my conscience\\r\\ndoes hurt me so, and every time I hit him my old heart\\r\\nmost breaks.  Well-a-well, man that is born of\\r\\nwoman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture\\r\\nsays, and I reckon it’s so.  He’ll\\r\\nplay hookey this evening,  and [ Southwestern for\\r\\n“afternoon”] I’ll just be obleeged\\r\\nto make him work, to-morrow, to punish him.  It’s\\r\\nmighty hard to make him work Saturdays, when all the\\r\\nboys is having holiday, but he hates work more than\\r\\nhe hates anything else, and I’ve got to\\r\\ndo some of my duty by him, or I’ll be the ruination\\r\\nof the child.” Tom did play hookey, and he had a\\r\\nvery good time.  He got back home barely in season\\r\\nto help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day’s\\r\\nwood and split the kindlings before supper ­at\\r\\nleast he was there in time to tell his adventures\\r\\nto Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work. \\r\\nTom’s younger brother (or rather half-brother)\\r\\nSid was already through with his part of the work\\r\\n(picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy, and had\\r\\nno adventurous, troublesome ways. While Tom was eating his supper, and\\r\\nstealing sugar as opportunity offered, Aunt Polly\\r\\nasked him questions that were full of guile, and very\\r\\ndeep ­for she wanted to trap him into damaging\\r\\nrevealments.  Like many other simple-hearted souls,\\r\\nit was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with\\r\\na talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she\\r\\nloved to contemplate her most transparent devices as\\r\\nmarvels of low cunning.  Said she:  “Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn’t\\r\\nit?” “Yes’m.” “Powerful warm, warn’t it?” “Yes’m.” “Didn’t you want to go in a-swimming,\\r\\nTom?” A bit of a scare shot through Tom ­a\\r\\ntouch of uncomfortable suspicion.  He searched\\r\\nAunt Polly’s face, but it told him nothing. \\r\\nSo he said:  “No’m ­well, not very much.” The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom’s\\r\\nshirt, and said:  “But you ain’t too warm\\r\\nnow, though.”  And it flattered her to reflect\\r\\nthat she had discovered that the shirt was dry without\\r\\nanybody knowing that that was what she had in her\\r\\nmind.  But in spite of her, Tom knew where the\\r\\nwind lay, now.  So he forestalled what might be\\r\\nthe next move:  “Some of us pumped on our heads ­mine’s\\r\\ndamp yet.  See?” Aunt Polly was vexed to think she\\r\\nhad overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence,\\r\\nand missed a trick.  Then she had a new inspiration:  “Tom, you didn’t have\\r\\nto undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump\\r\\non your head, did you?  Unbutton your jacket!” The trouble vanished out of Tom’s\\r\\nface.  He opened his jacket.  His shirt collar\\r\\nwas securely sewed. “Bother!  Well, go ’long\\r\\nwith you.  I’d made sure you’d played\\r\\nhookey and been a-swimming.  But I forgive ye,\\r\\nTom.  I reckon you’re a kind of a singed\\r\\ncat, as the saying is ­better’n you\\r\\nlook.  This time.” She was half sorry her sagacity had\\r\\nmiscarried, and half glad that Tom had stumbled into\\r\\nobedient conduct for once. But Sidney said:  “Well, now, if I didn’t\\r\\nthink you sewed his collar with white thread, but\\r\\nit’s black.” “Why, I did sew it with white!  Tom!” But Tom did not wait for the rest.  As he went\\r\\nout at the door he said:  “Siddy, I’ll lick you for that.” In a safe place Tom examined two large\\r\\nneedles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket,\\r\\nand had thread bound about them ­one needle\\r\\ncarried white thread and the other black.  He said:  “She’d never noticed if\\r\\nit hadn’t been for Sid.  Confound it! sometimes\\r\\nshe sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with\\r\\nblack.  I wish to geeminy she’d stick to\\r\\none or t’other ­I can’t keep\\r\\nthe run of ’em.  But I bet you I’ll\\r\\nlam Sid for that.  I’ll learn him!” He was not the Model Boy of the village. \\r\\nHe knew the model boy very well though ­and\\r\\nloathed him. Within two minutes, or even less,\\r\\nhe had forgotten all his troubles.  Not because\\r\\nhis troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to\\r\\nhim than a man’s are to a man, but because a\\r\\nnew and powerful interest bore them down and drove\\r\\nthem out of his mind for the time ­just as\\r\\nmen’s misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement\\r\\nof new enterprises.  This new interest was a valued\\r\\nnovelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from\\r\\na negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. \\r\\nIt consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of\\r\\nliquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to\\r\\nthe roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst\\r\\nof the music ­the reader probably remembers\\r\\nhow to do it, if he has ever been a boy.  Diligence\\r\\nand attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he\\r\\nstrode down the street with his mouth full of harmony\\r\\nand his soul full of gratitude.  He felt much as\\r\\nan astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet ­no\\r\\ndoubt, as far as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure\\r\\nis concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not\\r\\nthe astronomer. The summer evenings were long. \\r\\nIt was not dark, yet.  Presently Tom checked his\\r\\nwhistle.  A stranger was before him ­a\\r\\nboy a shade larger than himself.  A new-comer\\r\\nof any age or either sex was an impressive curiosity\\r\\nin the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. \\r\\nThis boy was well dressed, too ­well dressed\\r\\non a week-day.  This was simply astounding. \\r\\nHis cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue\\r\\ncloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his\\r\\npantaloons.  He had shoes on ­and it\\r\\nwas only Friday.  He even wore a necktie, a bright\\r\\nbit of ribbon.  He had a citified air about him\\r\\nthat ate into Tom’s vitals.  The more Tom\\r\\nstared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned\\r\\nup his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier\\r\\nhis own outfit seemed to him to grow.  Neither\\r\\nboy spoke.  If one moved, the other moved ­but\\r\\nonly sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face\\r\\nand eye to eye all the time.  Finally Tom said:  “I can lick you!” “I’d like to see you try it.” “Well, I can do it.” “No you can’t, either.” “Yes I can.” “No you can’t.” “I can.” “You can’t.” “Can!” “Can’t!” An uncomfortable pause.  Then Tom said:  “What’s your name?” “’Tisn’t any of your business, maybe.” “Well I ’low I’ll make it my\\r\\nbusiness.” “Well why don’t you?” “If you say much, I will.” “Much ­much ­much. \\r\\nThere now.” “Oh, you think you’re\\r\\nmighty smart, don’t you?  I could lick\\r\\nyou with one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.” “Well why don’t you do it?  You\\r\\nsay you can do it.” “Well I will, if you fool with me.” “Oh yes ­I’ve seen whole families\\r\\nin the same fix.” “Smarty!  You think you’re some,\\r\\nnow, don’t you?  Oh, what a hat!” “You can lump that hat if you\\r\\ndon’t like it.  I dare you to knock it off ­and\\r\\nanybody that’ll take a dare will suck eggs.” “You’re a liar!” “You’re another.” “You’re a fighting liar and dasn’t\\r\\ntake it up.” “Aw ­take a walk!” “Say ­if you give\\r\\nme much more of your sass I’ll take and bounce\\r\\na rock off’n your head.” “Oh, of course you will.” “Well I will.” “Well why don’t you do\\r\\nit then?  What do you keep saying you will\\r\\nfor?  Why don’t you do it?  It’s\\r\\nbecause you’re afraid.” “I ain’t afraid.” “You are.” “I ain’t.” “You are.” Another pause, and more eying and\\r\\nsidling around each other.  Presently they were\\r\\nshoulder to shoulder.  Tom said:  “Get away from here!” “Go away yourself!” “I won’t.” “I won’t either.” So they stood, each with a foot placed\\r\\nat an angle as a brace, and both shoving with might\\r\\nand main, and glowering at each other with hate. \\r\\nBut neither could get an advantage.  After struggling\\r\\ntill both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain\\r\\nwith watchful caution, and Tom said:  “You’re a coward and a\\r\\npup.  I’ll tell my big brother on you, and\\r\\nhe can thrash you with his little finger, and I’ll\\r\\nmake him do it, too.” “What do I care for your big\\r\\nbrother?  I’ve got a brother that’s\\r\\nbigger than he is ­and what’s more,\\r\\nhe can throw him over that fence, too.” [Both\\r\\nbrothers were imaginary.] “That’s a lie.” “Your saying so don’t make it so.” Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and\\r\\nsaid:  “I dare you to step over that,\\r\\nand I’ll lick you till you can’t stand\\r\\nup.  Anybody that’ll take a dare will steal\\r\\nsheep.” The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:  “Now you said you’d do it, now let’s\\r\\nsee you do it.” “Don’t you crowd me now; you better look\\r\\nout.” “Well, you said you’d do it ­why\\r\\ndon’t you do it?” “By jingo! for two cents I will do it.” The new boy took two broad coppers\\r\\nout of his pocket and held them out with derision. \\r\\nTom struck them to the ground.  In an instant both\\r\\nboys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped\\r\\ntogether like cats; and for the space of a minute\\r\\nthey tugged and tore at each other’s hair and\\r\\nclothes, punched and scratched each other’s nose,\\r\\nand covered themselves with dust and glory.  Presently\\r\\nthe confusion took form, and through the fog of battle\\r\\nTom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding\\r\\nhim with his fists.  “Holler ’nuff!”\\r\\nsaid he. The boy only struggled to free himself.  He was\\r\\ncrying ­mainly from rage. “Holler ’nuff!” ­and the\\r\\npounding went on. At last the stranger got out a smothered\\r\\n“’Nuff!” and Tom let him up and\\r\\nsaid:  “Now that’ll learn you. \\r\\nBetter look out who you’re fooling with next\\r\\ntime.” The new boy went off brushing the\\r\\ndust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally\\r\\nlooking back and shaking his head and threatening\\r\\nwhat he would do to Tom the “next time he caught\\r\\nhim out.”  To which Tom responded with jeers,\\r\\nand started off in high feather, and as soon as his\\r\\nback was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw\\r\\nit and hit him between the shoulders and then turned\\r\\ntail and ran like an antelope.  Tom chased the\\r\\ntraitor home, and thus found out where he lived. \\r\\nHe then held a position at the gate for some time,\\r\\ndaring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only\\r\\nmade faces at him through the window and declined. \\r\\nAt last the enemy’s mother appeared, and called\\r\\nTom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. \\r\\nSo he went away; but he said he “’lowed”\\r\\nto “lay” for that boy. He got home pretty late that night,\\r\\nand when he climbed cautiously in at the window, he\\r\\nuncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt;\\r\\nand when she saw the state his clothes were in her\\r\\nresolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity\\r\\nat hard labor became adamantine in its firmness.



       "2 Saturday morning was come, and\\r\\nall the summer world was bright and fresh, and brimming\\r\\nwith life.  There was a song in every heart; and\\r\\nif the heart was young the music issued at the lips. \\r\\nThere was cheer in every face and a spring in every\\r\\nstep.  The locust-trees were in bloom and the\\r\\nfragrance of the blossoms filled the air.  Cardiff\\r\\nHill, beyond the village and above it, was green with\\r\\nvegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem\\r\\na Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting. Tom appeared on the sidewalk with\\r\\na bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. \\r\\nHe surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and\\r\\na deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. \\r\\nThirty yards of board fence nine feet high.  Life\\r\\nto him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. \\r\\nSighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the\\r\\ntopmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again;\\r\\ncompared the insignificant whitewashed streak with\\r\\nthe far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence,\\r\\nand sat down on a tree-box discouraged.  Jim came\\r\\nskipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and singing\\r\\nBuffalo Gals.  Bringing water from the town pump\\r\\nhad always been hateful work in Tom’s eyes, before,\\r\\nbut now it did not strike him so.  He remembered\\r\\nthat there was company at the pump.  White, mulatto,\\r\\nand negro boys and girls were always there waiting\\r\\ntheir turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling,\\r\\nfighting, skylarking.  And he remembered that although\\r\\nthe pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim\\r\\nnever got back with a bucket of water under an hour ­and\\r\\neven then somebody generally had to go after him. \\r\\nTom said:  “Say, Jim, I’ll fetch\\r\\nthe water if you’ll whitewash some.” Jim shook his head and said:  “Can’t, Mars Tom. \\r\\nOlé missis, she tole me I got to go an’\\r\\ngit dis water an’ not stop foolin’\\r\\nroun’ wid anybody.  She say she spec’\\r\\nMars Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash, an’ so\\r\\nshe tole me go ‘long an’ ’tend to\\r\\nmy own business ­she ’lowed she’d\\r\\n’tend to de whitewashin’.” “Oh, never you mind what she\\r\\nsaid, Jim.  That’s the way she always talks. \\r\\nGimme the bucket ­I won’t be gone only\\r\\na a minute.  She won’t ever know.” “Oh, I dasn’t, Mars Tom. \\r\\nOlé missis she’d take an’ tar de head\\r\\noff’n me.  ’Deed she would.” “She!  She never licks\\r\\nanybody ­whacks ’em over the head with\\r\\nher thimble ­and who cares for that, I’d\\r\\nlike to know.  She talks awful, but talk don’t\\r\\nhurt ­anyways it don’t if she don’t\\r\\ncry.  Jim, I’ll give you a marvel. \\r\\nI’ll give you a white alley!” Jim began to waver. “White alley, Jim!  And it’s a bully\\r\\ntaw.” “My!  Dat’s a mighty\\r\\ngay marvel, I tell you!  But Mars Tom I’s\\r\\npowerful ’fraid olé missis ­” “And besides, if you will I’ll show you\\r\\nmy sore toe.” Jim was only human ­this\\r\\nattraction was too much for him.  He put down\\r\\nhis pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe\\r\\nwith absorbing interest while the bandage was being\\r\\nunwound.  In another moment he was flying down\\r\\nthe street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was\\r\\nwhitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring\\r\\nfrom the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph\\r\\nin her eye. But Tom’s energy did not last. \\r\\nHe began to think of the fun he had planned for this\\r\\nday, and his sorrows multiplied.  Soon the free\\r\\nboys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious\\r\\nexpeditions, and they would make a world of fun of\\r\\nhim for having to work ­the very thought\\r\\nof it burnt him like fire.  He got out his worldly\\r\\nwealth and examined it ­bits of toys, marbles,\\r\\nand trash; enough to buy an exchange of work,\\r\\nmaybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an\\r\\nhour of pure freedom.  So he returned his straitened\\r\\nmeans to his pocket, and gave up the idea of trying\\r\\nto buy the boys.  At this dark and hopeless moment\\r\\nan inspiration burst upon him!  Nothing less than\\r\\na great, magnificent inspiration. He took up his brush and went tranquilly\\r\\nto work.  Ben Rogers hove in sight presently ­the\\r\\nvery boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been\\r\\ndreading.  Ben’s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump ­proof\\r\\nenough that his heart was light and his anticipations\\r\\nhigh.  He was eating an apple, and giving a long,\\r\\nmelodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned\\r\\nding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating\\r\\na steamboat.  As he drew near, he slackened speed,\\r\\ntook the middle of the street, leaned far over to\\r\\nstarboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious\\r\\npomp and circumstance ­for he was personating\\r\\nthe Big Missouri, and considered himself to be drawing\\r\\nnine feet of water.  He was boat and captain and\\r\\nengine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself\\r\\nstanding on his own hurricane-deck giving the orders\\r\\nand executing them:  “Stop her, sir!  Ting-a-ling-ling!”\\r\\nThe headway ran almost out, and he drew up slowly\\r\\ntoward the sidewalk. “Ship up to back!  Ting-a-ling-ling!”\\r\\nHis arms straightened and stiffened down his sides. “Set her back on the stabboard! \\r\\nTing-a-ling-ling!  Chow! ch-chow-wow! \\r\\nChow!” His right hand, meantime, describing stately\\r\\ncircles ­for it was representing a forty-foot\\r\\nwheel. “Let her go back on the labboard! \\r\\nTing-a-lingling!  Chow-ch-chow-chow!”\\r\\nThe left hand began to describe circles. “Stop the stabboard!  Ting-a-ling-ling! \\r\\nStop the labboard!  Come ahead on the stabboard! \\r\\nStop her!  Let your outside turn over slow! \\r\\nTing-a-ling-ling!  Chow-ow-ow!  Get out that\\r\\nhead-line!  Lively now!  Come ­out\\r\\nwith your spring-line ­what’re you\\r\\nabout there!  Take a turn round that stump with\\r\\nthe bight of it!  Stand by that stage, now ­let\\r\\nher go!  Done with the engines, sir!  Ting-a-ling-ling! \\r\\nSH’T!  S’H’T!  SH’T!”\\r\\n(trying the gauge-cocks). Tom went on whitewashing ­paid\\r\\nno attention to the steamboat.  Ben stared a moment\\r\\nand then said:  “Hi-Yi!  You’re\\r\\nup a stump, ain’t you!” No answer.  Tom surveyed his last\\r\\ntouch with the eye of an artist, then he gave his\\r\\nbrush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result,\\r\\nas before.  Ben ranged up alongside of him. \\r\\nTom’s mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck\\r\\nto his work.  Ben said:  “Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?” Tom wheeled suddenly and said:  “Why, it’s you, Ben!  I warn’t\\r\\nnoticing.” “Say ­I’m going\\r\\nin a-swimming, I am.  Don’t you wish you\\r\\ncould?  But of course you’d druther work ­wouldn’t\\r\\nyou?  Course you would!” Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:  “What do you call work?” “Why, ain’t that work?” Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:  “Well, maybe it is, and maybe\\r\\nit ain’t.  All I know, is, it suits Tom\\r\\nSawyer.” “Oh come, now, you don’t mean to let on\\r\\nthat you like it?” The brush continued to move. “Like it?  Well, I don’t\\r\\nsee why I oughtn’t to like it.  Does a boy\\r\\nget a chance to whitewash a fence every day?” That put the thing in a new light. \\r\\nBen stopped nibbling his apple.  Tom swept his\\r\\nbrush daintily back and forth ­stepped back\\r\\nto note the effect ­added a touch here and\\r\\nthere ­criticised the effect again ­Ben\\r\\nwatching every move and getting more and more interested,\\r\\nmore and more absorbed.  Presently he said:  “Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.” Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered\\r\\nhis mind:  “No ­no ­I\\r\\nreckon it wouldn’t hardly do, Ben.  You see,\\r\\nAunt Polly’s awful particular about this fence ­right\\r\\nhere on the street, you know  ­but if it\\r\\nwas the back fence I wouldn’t mind and she\\r\\nwouldn’t.  Yes, she’s awful particular\\r\\nabout this fence; it’s got to be done very careful;\\r\\nI reckon there ain’t one boy in a thousand, maybe\\r\\ntwo thousand, that can do it the way it’s got\\r\\nto be done.” “No ­is that so? \\r\\nOh come, now ­lemme just try.  Only\\r\\njust a little ­I’d let you, if\\r\\nyou was me, Tom.” “Ben, I’d like to, honest\\r\\ninjun; but Aunt Polly ­well, Jim wanted to\\r\\ndo it, but she wouldn’t let him; Sid wanted to\\r\\ndo it, and she wouldn’t let Sid.  Now don’t\\r\\nyou see how I’m fixed?  If you was to tackle\\r\\nthis fence and anything was to happen to it ­” “Oh, shucks, I’ll be just\\r\\nas careful.  Now lemme try.  Say ­I’ll\\r\\ngive you the core of my apple.” “Well, here ­No, Ben, now don’t. \\r\\nI’m afeard ­” “I’ll give you all of it!” Tom gave up the brush with reluctance\\r\\nin his face, but alacrity in his heart.  And while\\r\\nthe late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in\\r\\nthe sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the\\r\\nshade close by, dangled his legs, munched his apple,\\r\\nand planned the slaughter of more innocents. \\r\\nThere was no lack of material; boys happened along\\r\\nevery little while; they came to jeer, but remained\\r\\nto whitewash.  By the time Ben was fagged out,\\r\\nTom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for\\r\\na kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny\\r\\nMiller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing\\r\\nit with ­and so on, and so on, hour after\\r\\nhour.  And when the middle of the afternoon came,\\r\\nfrom being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning,\\r\\nTom was literally rolling in wealth.  He had besides\\r\\nthe things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part\\r\\nof a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look\\r\\nthrough, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn’t\\r\\nunlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper\\r\\nof a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles,\\r\\nsix fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass\\r\\ndoorknob, a dog-collar ­but no dog ­the\\r\\nhandle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel, and\\r\\na dilapidated old window sash. He had had a nice, good, idle time\\r\\nall the while ­plenty of company  ­and\\r\\nthe fence had three coats of whitewash on it! \\r\\nIf he hadn’t run out of whitewash he would have\\r\\nbankrupted every boy in the village. Tom said to himself that it was not\\r\\nsuch a hollow world, after all.  He had discovered\\r\\na great law of human action, without knowing it ­namely,\\r\\nthat in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing,\\r\\nit is only necessary to make the thing difficult to\\r\\nattain.  If he had been a great and wise philosopher,\\r\\nlike the writer of this book, he would now have comprehended\\r\\nthat Work consists of whatever a body is obliged\\r\\nto do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is\\r\\nnot obliged to do.  And this would help him to\\r\\nunderstand why constructing artificial flowers or\\r\\nperforming on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins\\r\\nor climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement.  There\\r\\nare wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse\\r\\npassenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily\\r\\nline, in the summer, because the privilege costs them\\r\\nconsiderable money; but if they were offered wages\\r\\nfor the service, that would turn it into work and\\r\\nthen they would resign. The boy mused awhile over the substantial\\r\\nchange which had taken place in his worldly circumstances,\\r\\nand then wended toward headquarters to report.

       "3 Tom presented himself before\\r\\nAunt Polly, who was sitting by an open window in a\\r\\npleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom, breakfast-room,\\r\\ndining-room, and library, combined.  The balmy\\r\\nsummer air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers,\\r\\nand the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their\\r\\neffect, and she was nodding over her knitting  ­for\\r\\nshe had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in\\r\\nher lap.  Her spectacles were propped up on her\\r\\ngray head for safety.  She had thought that of\\r\\ncourse Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered\\r\\nat seeing him place himself in her power again in\\r\\nthis intrepid way.  He said:  “Mayn’t\\r\\nI go and play now, aunt?” “What, a’ready?  How much have you\\r\\ndone?” “It’s all done, aunt.” “Tom, don’t lie to me ­I can’t\\r\\nbear it.” “I ain’t, aunt; it is all done.” Aunt Polly placed small trust in such\\r\\nevidence.  She went out to see for herself; and\\r\\nshe would have been content to find twenty per cent.\\r\\nof Tom’s statement true.  When she found\\r\\nthe entire fence whitewashed, and not only whitewashed\\r\\nbut elaborately coated and recoated, and even a streak\\r\\nadded to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. \\r\\nShe said:  “Well, I never!  There’s\\r\\nno getting round it, you can work when you’re\\r\\na mind to, Tom.”  And then she diluted the\\r\\ncompliment by adding, “But it’s powerful\\r\\nseldom you’re a mind to, I’m bound to say. \\r\\nWell, go ’long and play; but mind you get back\\r\\nsome time in a week, or I’ll tan you.” She was so overcome by the splendor\\r\\nof his achievement that she took him into the closet\\r\\nand selected a choice apple and delivered it to him,\\r\\nalong with an improving lecture upon the added value\\r\\nand flavor a treat took to itself when it came without\\r\\nsin through virtuous effort.  And while she closed\\r\\nwith a happy Scriptural flourish, he “hooked”\\r\\na doughnut. Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just\\r\\nstarting up the outside stairway that led to the back\\r\\nrooms on the second floor.  Clods were handy and\\r\\nthe air was full of them in a twinkling.  They\\r\\nraged around Sid like a hail-storm; and before Aunt\\r\\nPolly could collect her surprised faculties and sally\\r\\nto the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal\\r\\neffect, and Tom was over the fence and gone. \\r\\nThere was a gate, but as a general thing he was too\\r\\ncrowded for time to make use of it.  His soul was\\r\\nat peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling\\r\\nattention to his black thread and getting him into\\r\\ntrouble. Tom skirted the block, and came round\\r\\ninto a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunt’s\\r\\ncow-stable.  He presently got safely beyond the\\r\\nreach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward\\r\\nthe public square of the village, where two “military”\\r\\ncompanies of boys had met for conflict, according\\r\\nto previous appointment.  Tom was General of one\\r\\nof these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General\\r\\nof the other.  These two great commanders did\\r\\nnot condescend to fight in person ­that being\\r\\nbetter suited to the still smaller fry ­but\\r\\nsat together on an eminence and conducted the field\\r\\noperations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp. \\r\\nTom’s army won a great victory, after a long\\r\\nand hard-fought battle.  Then the dead were counted,\\r\\nprisoners exchanged, the terms of the next disagreement\\r\\nagreed upon, and the day for the necessary battle\\r\\nappointed; after which the armies fell into line and\\r\\nmarched away, and Tom turned homeward alone. As he was passing by the house where\\r\\nJeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new girl in the garden ­a\\r\\nlovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow hair\\r\\nplaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and\\r\\nembroidered pantalettes.  The fresh-crowned hero\\r\\nfell without firing a shot.  A certain Amy Lawrence\\r\\nvanished out of his heart and left not even a memory\\r\\nof herself behind.  He had thought he loved her\\r\\nto distraction; he had regarded his passion as adoration;\\r\\nand behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality. \\r\\nHe had been months winning her; she had confessed\\r\\nhardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the\\r\\nproudest boy in the world only seven short days, and\\r\\nhere in one instant of time she had gone out of his\\r\\nheart like a casual stranger whose visit is done. He worshipped this new angel with\\r\\nfurtive eye, till he saw that she had discovered him;\\r\\nthen he pretended he did not know she was present,\\r\\nand began to “show off” in all sorts of\\r\\nabsurd boyish ways, in order to win her admiration. \\r\\nHe kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time;\\r\\nbut by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous\\r\\ngymnastic performances, he glanced aside and saw that\\r\\nthe little girl was wending her way toward the house. \\r\\nTom came up to the fence and leaned on it, grieving,\\r\\nand hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. \\r\\nShe halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward\\r\\nthe door.  Tom heaved a great sigh as she put\\r\\nher foot on the threshold.  But his face lit up,\\r\\nright away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a\\r\\nmoment before she disappeared. The boy ran around and stopped within\\r\\na foot or two of the flower, and then shaded his eyes\\r\\nwith his hand and began to look down street as if\\r\\nhe had discovered something of interest going on in\\r\\nthat direction.  Presently he picked up a straw\\r\\nand began trying to balance it on his nose, with his\\r\\nhead tilted far back; and as he moved from side to\\r\\nside, in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward\\r\\nthe pansy; finally his bare foot rested upon it, his\\r\\npliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped away with\\r\\nthe treasure and disappeared round the corner. \\r\\nBut only for a minute ­only while he could\\r\\nbutton the flower inside his jacket, next his heart ­or\\r\\nnext his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted\\r\\nin anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway. He returned, now, and hung about the\\r\\nfence till nightfall, “showing off,” as\\r\\nbefore; but the girl never exhibited herself again,\\r\\nthough Tom comforted himself a little with the hope\\r\\nthat she had been near some window, meantime, and\\r\\nbeen aware of his attentions.  Finally he strode\\r\\nhome reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions. All through supper his spirits were\\r\\nso high that his aunt wondered “what had got\\r\\ninto the child.”  He took a good scolding\\r\\nabout clodding Sid, and did not seem to mind it in\\r\\nthe least.  He tried to steal sugar under his\\r\\naunt’s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped\\r\\nfor it.  He said:  “Aunt, you don’t whack Sid when he takes\\r\\nit.” “Well, Sid don’t torment\\r\\na body the way you do.  You’d be always into\\r\\nthat sugar if I warn’t watching you.” Presently she stepped into the kitchen,\\r\\nand Sid, happy in his immunity, reached for the sugar-bowl ­a\\r\\nsort of glorying over Tom which was wellnigh unbearable. \\r\\nBut Sid’s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped\\r\\nand broke.  Tom was in ecstasies.  In such\\r\\necstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was\\r\\nsilent.  He said to himself that he would not\\r\\nspeak a word, even when his aunt came in, but would\\r\\nsit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief;\\r\\nand then he would tell, and there would be nothing\\r\\nso good in the world as to see that pet model “catch\\r\\nit.”  He was so brimful of exultation that\\r\\nhe could hardly hold himself when the old lady came\\r\\nback and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings\\r\\nof wrath from over her spectacles.  He said to\\r\\nhimself, “Now it’s coming!” And the\\r\\nnext instant he was sprawling on the floor!  The\\r\\npotent palm was uplifted to strike again when Tom cried\\r\\nout:  “Hold on, now, what ’er\\r\\nyou belting me for? ­Sid broke it!” Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and\\r\\nTom looked for healing pity.  But when she got\\r\\nher tongue again, she only said:  “Umf!  Well, you didn’t\\r\\nget a lick amiss, I reckon.  You been into some\\r\\nother audacious mischief when I wasn’t around,\\r\\nlike enough.” Then her conscience reproached her,\\r\\nand she yearned to say something kind and loving;\\r\\nbut she judged that this would be construed into a\\r\\nconfession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline\\r\\nforbade that.  So she kept silence, and went about\\r\\nher affairs with a troubled heart.  Tom sulked\\r\\nin a corner and exalted his woes.  He knew that\\r\\nin her heart his aunt was on her knees to him, and\\r\\nhe was morosely gratified by the consciousness of\\r\\nit.  He would hang out no signals, he would take\\r\\nnotice of none.  He knew that a yearning glance\\r\\nfell upon him, now and then, through a film of tears,\\r\\nbut he refused recognition of it.  He pictured\\r\\nhimself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending\\r\\nover him beseeching one little forgiving word, but\\r\\nhe would turn his face to the wall, and die with that\\r\\nword unsaid.  Ah, how would she feel then? \\r\\nAnd he pictured himself brought home from the river,\\r\\ndead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at\\r\\nrest.  How she would throw herself upon him, and\\r\\nhow her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray\\r\\nGod to give her back her boy and she would never,\\r\\nnever abuse him any more!  But he would lie there\\r\\ncold and white and make no sign ­a poor little\\r\\nsufferer, whose griefs were at an end.  He so\\r\\nworked upon his feelings with the pathos of these\\r\\ndreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like\\r\\nto choke; and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which\\r\\noverflowed when he winked, and ran down and trickled\\r\\nfrom the end of his nose.  And such a luxury to\\r\\nhim was this petting of his sorrows, that he could\\r\\nnot bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating\\r\\ndelight intrude upon it; it was too sacred for such\\r\\ncontact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced\\r\\nin, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after\\r\\nan age-long visit of one week to the country, he got\\r\\nup and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door\\r\\nas she brought song and sunshine in at the other. He wandered far from the accustomed\\r\\nhaunts of boys, and sought desolate places that were\\r\\nin harmony with his spirit.  A log raft in the\\r\\nriver invited him, and he seated himself on its outer\\r\\nedge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream,\\r\\nwishing, the while, that he could only be drowned,\\r\\nall at once and unconsciously, without undergoing\\r\\nthe uncomfortable routine devised by nature.  Then\\r\\nhe thought of his flower.  He got it out, rumpled\\r\\nand wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal felicity. \\r\\nHe wondered if she would pity him if she knew? \\r\\nWould she cry, and wish that she had a right to put\\r\\nher arms around his neck and comfort him?  Or\\r\\nwould she turn coldly away like all the hollow world? \\r\\nThis picture brought such an agony of pleasurable\\r\\nsuffering that he worked it over and over again in\\r\\nhis mind and set it up in new and varied lights, till\\r\\nhe wore it threadbare.  At last he rose up sighing\\r\\nand departed in the darkness. About half-past nine or ten o’clock\\r\\nhe came along the deserted street to where the Adored\\r\\nUnknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon\\r\\nhis listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow\\r\\nupon the curtain of a second-story window.  Was\\r\\nthe sacred presence there?  He climbed the fence,\\r\\nthreaded his stealthy way through the plants, till\\r\\nhe stood under that window; he looked up at it long,\\r\\nand with emotion; then he laid him down on the ground\\r\\nunder it, disposing himself upon his back, with his\\r\\nhands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor\\r\\nwilted flower.  And thus he would die ­out\\r\\nin the cold world, with no shelter over his homeless\\r\\nhead, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from\\r\\nhis brow, no loving face to bend pityingly over him\\r\\nwhen the great agony came.  And thus she would\\r\\nsee him when she looked out upon the glad morning,\\r\\nand oh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor,\\r\\nlifeless form, would she heave one little sigh to see\\r\\na bright young life so rudely blighted, so untimely\\r\\ncut down? The window went up, a maid-servant’s\\r\\ndiscordant voice profaned the holy calm, and a deluge\\r\\nof water drenched the prone martyr’s remains! The strangling hero sprang up with\\r\\na relieving snort.  There was a whiz as of a missile\\r\\nin the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound\\r\\nas of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague\\r\\nform went over the fence and shot away in the gloom. Not long after, as Tom, all undressed\\r\\nfor bed, was surveying his drenched garments by the\\r\\nlight of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he had\\r\\nany dim idea of making any “references to allusions,”\\r\\nhe thought better of it and held his peace, for there\\r\\nwas danger in Tom’s eye. Tom turned in without the added vexation\\r\\nof prayers, and Sid made mental note of the omission.

       "4 The sun rose upon a tranquil\\r\\nworld, and beamed down upon the peaceful village like\\r\\na benediction.  Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had\\r\\nfamily worship:  it began with a prayer built\\r\\nfrom the ground up of solid courses of Scriptural\\r\\nquotations, welded together with a thin mortar of\\r\\noriginality; and from the summit of this she delivered\\r\\na grim chapter of the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai. Then Tom girded up his loins, so to\\r\\nspeak, and went to work to “get his verses.” \\r\\nSid had learned his lesson days before.  Tom bent\\r\\nall his energies to the memorizing of five verses,\\r\\nand he chose part of the Sermon on the Mount, because\\r\\nhe could find no verses that were shorter.  At\\r\\nthe end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea\\r\\nof his lesson, but no more, for his mind was traversing\\r\\nthe whole field of human thought, and his hands were\\r\\nbusy with distracting recreations.  Mary took\\r\\nhis book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his\\r\\nway through the fog:  “Blessed are the ­a ­a ­” “Poor” ­ “Yes ­poor; blessed are the poor ­a ­a ­” “In spirit ­” “In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit,\\r\\nfor they ­they ­” “Theirs ­” “For theirs.  Blessed\\r\\nare the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom\\r\\nof heaven.  Blessed are they that mourn, for they ­they ­” “Sh ­” “For they ­a ­” “S, H, A ­” “For they S, H ­Oh, I don’t\\r\\nknow what it is!” “Shall!” “Oh, shall! for they shall ­for\\r\\nthey shall ­a ­a ­shall\\r\\nmourn ­a ­a ­ blessed\\r\\nare they that shall ­they that ­a ­they\\r\\nthat shall mourn, for they shall ­a ­shall\\r\\nwhat?  Why don’t you tell me, Mary? ­what\\r\\ndo you want to be so mean for?” “Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed\\r\\nthing, I’m not teasing you.  I wouldn’t\\r\\ndo that.  You must go and learn it again. \\r\\nDon’t you be discouraged, Tom, you’ll\\r\\nmanage it ­and if you do, I’ll give\\r\\nyou something ever so nice.  There, now, that’s\\r\\na good boy.” “All right!  What is it, Mary, tell me what\\r\\nit is.” “Never you mind, Tom.  You know if I say\\r\\nit’s nice, it is nice.” “You bet you that’s so, Mary.  All\\r\\nright, I’ll tackle it again.” And he did “tackle it again” ­and\\r\\nunder the double pressure of curiosity and prospective\\r\\ngain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished\\r\\na shining success.  Mary gave him a brand-new “Barlow”\\r\\nknife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion\\r\\nof delight that swept his system shook him to his\\r\\nfoundations.  True, the knife would not cut anything,\\r\\nbut it was a “sure-enough” Barlow, and\\r\\nthere was inconceivable grandeur in that ­though\\r\\nwhere the Western boys ever got the idea that such\\r\\na weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury\\r\\nis an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. \\r\\nTom contrived to scarify the cupboard with it, and\\r\\nwas arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was\\r\\ncalled off to dress for Sunday-school. Mary gave him a tin basin of water\\r\\nand a piece of soap, and he went outside the door\\r\\nand set the basin on a little bench there; then he\\r\\ndipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned\\r\\nup his sleeves; poured out the water on the ground,\\r\\ngently, and then entered the kitchen and began to\\r\\nwipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. \\r\\nBut Mary removed the towel and said:  “Now ain’t you ashamed,\\r\\nTom.  You mustn’t be so bad.  Water won’t\\r\\nhurt you.” Tom was a trifle disconcerted. \\r\\nThe basin was refilled, and this time he stood over\\r\\nit a little while, gathering resolution; took in a\\r\\nbig breath and began.  When he entered the kitchen\\r\\npresently, with both eyes shut and groping for the\\r\\ntowel with his hands, an honorable testimony of suds\\r\\nand water was dripping from his face.  But when\\r\\nhe emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory,\\r\\nfor the clean territory stopped short at his chin\\r\\nand his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line\\r\\nthere was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread\\r\\ndownward in front and backward around his neck. \\r\\nMary took him in hand, and when she was done with\\r\\nhim he was a man and a brother, without distinction\\r\\nof color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed,\\r\\nand its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical\\r\\ngeneral effect. [He privately smoothed out the curls,\\r\\nwith labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair\\r\\nclose down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate,\\r\\nand his own filled his life with bitterness.] Then\\r\\nMary got out a suit of his clothing that had been\\r\\nused only on Sundays during two years ­they\\r\\nwere simply called his “other clothes” ­and\\r\\nso by that we know the size of his wardrobe. \\r\\nThe girl “put him to rights” after he had\\r\\ndressed himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout\\r\\nup to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar down\\r\\nover his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him\\r\\nwith his speckled straw hat.  He now looked exceedingly\\r\\nimproved and uncomfortable.  He was fully as uncomfortable\\r\\nas he looked; for there was a restraint about whole\\r\\nclothes and cleanliness that galled him.  He hoped\\r\\nthat Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was\\r\\nblighted; she coated them thoroughly with tallow,\\r\\nas was the custom, and brought them out.  He lost\\r\\nhis temper and said he was always being made to do\\r\\neverything he didn’t want to do.  But Mary\\r\\nsaid, persuasively:  “Please, Tom ­that’s a good\\r\\nboy.” So he got into the shoes snarling. \\r\\nMary was soon ready, and the three children set out\\r\\nfor Sunday-school ­a place that Tom hated\\r\\nwith his whole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of\\r\\nit. Sabbath-school hours were from nine\\r\\nto half-past ten; and then church service.  Two\\r\\nof the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,\\r\\nand the other always remained too ­for stronger\\r\\nreasons.  The church’s high-backed, uncushioned\\r\\npews would seat about three hundred persons; the edifice\\r\\nwas but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine\\r\\nboard tree-box on top of it for a steeple.  At\\r\\nthe door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a Sunday-dressed\\r\\ncomrade:  “Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?” “Yes.” “What’ll you take for her?” “What’ll you give?” “Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.” “Less see ’em.” Tom exhibited.  They were satisfactory,\\r\\nand the property changed hands.  Then Tom traded\\r\\na couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and\\r\\nsome small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. \\r\\nHe waylaid other boys as they came, and went on buying\\r\\ntickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer. \\r\\nHe entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean\\r\\nand noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and\\r\\nstarted a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. \\r\\nThe teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered; then\\r\\nturned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy’s\\r\\nhair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book\\r\\nwhen the boy turned around; stuck a pin in another\\r\\nboy, presently, in order to hear him say “Ouch!”\\r\\nand got a new reprimand from his teacher.  Tom’s\\r\\nwhole class were of a pattern ­restless,\\r\\nnoisy, and troublesome.  When they came to recite\\r\\ntheir lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly,\\r\\nbut had to be prompted all along.  However, they\\r\\nworried through, and each got his reward ­in\\r\\nsmall blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture\\r\\non it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of\\r\\nthe recitation.  Ten blue tickets equalled a red\\r\\none, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets\\r\\nequalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the\\r\\nsuperintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth\\r\\nforty cents in those easy times) to the pupil. \\r\\nHow many of my readers would have the industry and\\r\\napplication to memorize two thousand verses, even\\r\\nfor a Dore Bible?  And yet Mary had acquired two\\r\\nBibles in this way ­it was the patient work\\r\\nof two years ­and a boy of German parentage\\r\\nhad won four or five.  He once recited three thousand\\r\\nverses without stopping; but the strain upon his mental\\r\\nfaculties was too great, and he was little better\\r\\nthan an idiot from that day forth ­a grievous\\r\\nmisfortune for the school, for on great occasions,\\r\\nbefore company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed\\r\\nit) had always made this boy come out and “spread\\r\\nhimself.”  Only the older pupils managed\\r\\nto keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work\\r\\nlong enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of\\r\\none of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance;\\r\\nthe successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for\\r\\nthat day that on the spot every scholar’s heart\\r\\nwas fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted\\r\\na couple of weeks.  It is possible that Tom’s\\r\\nmental stomach had never really hungered for one of\\r\\nthose prizes, but unquestionably his entire being\\r\\nhad for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat\\r\\nthat came with it. In due course the superintendent stood\\r\\nup in front of the pulpit, with a closed hymn-book\\r\\nin his hand and his forefinger inserted between its\\r\\nleaves, and commanded attention.  When a Sunday-school\\r\\nsuperintendent makes his customary little speech,\\r\\na hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the\\r\\ninevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer\\r\\nwho stands forward on the platform and sings a solo\\r\\nat a concert  ­though why, is a mystery: \\r\\nfor neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is\\r\\never referred to by the sufferer.  This superintendent\\r\\nwas a slim creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee\\r\\nand short sandy hair; he wore a stiff standing-collar\\r\\nwhose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose\\r\\nsharp points curved forward abreast the corners of\\r\\nhis mouth ­a fence that compelled a straight\\r\\nlookout ahead, and a turning of the whole body when\\r\\na side view was required; his chin was propped on\\r\\na spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as\\r\\na bank-note, and had fringed ends; his boot toes were\\r\\nturned sharply up, in the fashion of the day, like\\r\\nsleigh-runners ­an effect patiently and\\r\\nlaboriously produced by the young men by sitting with\\r\\ntheir toes pressed against a wall for hours together. \\r\\nMr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very sincere\\r\\nand honest at heart; and he held sacred things and\\r\\nplaces in such reverence, and so separated them from\\r\\nworldly matters, that unconsciously to himself his\\r\\nSunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation\\r\\nwhich was wholly absent on week-days.  He began\\r\\nafter this fashion:  “Now, children, I want you all\\r\\nto sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and\\r\\ngive me all your attention for a minute or two. \\r\\nThere  ­that is it.  That is the way\\r\\ngood little boys and girls should do.  I see one\\r\\nlittle girl who is looking out of the window ­I\\r\\nam afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere ­perhaps\\r\\nup in one of the trees making a speech to the little\\r\\nbirds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how\\r\\ngood it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean\\r\\nlittle faces assembled in a place like this, learning\\r\\nto do right and be good.”  And so forth\\r\\nand so on.  It is not necessary to set down the\\r\\nrest of the oration.  It was of a pattern which\\r\\ndoes not vary, and so it is familiar to us all. The latter third of the speech was\\r\\nmarred by the resumption of fights and other recreations\\r\\namong certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings and\\r\\nwhisperings that extended far and wide, washing even\\r\\nto the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like\\r\\nSid and Mary.  But now every sound ceased suddenly,\\r\\nwith the subsidence of Mr. Walters’ voice, and\\r\\nthe conclusion of the speech was received with a burst\\r\\nof silent gratitude. A good part of the whispering had\\r\\nbeen occasioned by an event which was more or less\\r\\nrare ­the entrance of visitors:  lawyer\\r\\nThatcher, accompanied by a very feeble and aged man;\\r\\na fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray\\r\\nhair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter’s\\r\\nwife.  The lady was leading a child.  Tom had\\r\\nbeen restless and full of chafings and repinings;\\r\\nconscience-smitten, too ­he could not meet\\r\\nAmy Lawrence’s eye, he could not brook her loving\\r\\ngaze.  But when he saw this small new-comer his\\r\\nsoul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment.  The\\r\\nnext moment he was “showing off” with all\\r\\nhis might  ­cuffing boys, pulling hair,\\r\\nmaking faces ­in a word, using every art\\r\\nthat seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her\\r\\napplause.  His exaltation had but one alloy ­the\\r\\nmemory of his humiliation in this angel’s garden ­and\\r\\nthat record in sand was fast washing out, under the\\r\\nwaves of happiness that were sweeping over it now. The visitors were given the highest\\r\\nseat of honor, and as soon as Mr. Walters’ speech\\r\\nwas finished, he introduced them to the school. \\r\\nThe middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious\\r\\npersonage ­no less a one than the county\\r\\njudge ­altogether the most august creation\\r\\nthese children had ever looked upon ­and\\r\\nthey wondered what kind of material he was made of ­and\\r\\nthey half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid\\r\\nhe might, too.  He was from Constantinople, twelve\\r\\nmiles away ­so he had travelled, and seen\\r\\nthe world ­these very eyes had looked upon\\r\\nthe county court-house ­which was said to\\r\\nhave a tin roof.  The awe which these reflections\\r\\ninspired was attested by the impressive silence and\\r\\nthe ranks of staring eyes.  This was the great\\r\\nJudge Thatcher, brother of their own lawyer. \\r\\nJeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar\\r\\nwith the great man and be envied by the school. \\r\\nIt would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings:  “Look at him, Jim!  He’s\\r\\na going up there.  Say ­look! he’s\\r\\na going to shake hands with him ­he is\\r\\nshaking hands with him!  By jings, don’t\\r\\nyou wish you was Jeff?” Mr. Walters fell to “showing\\r\\noff,” with all sorts of official bustlings and\\r\\nactivities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging\\r\\ndirections here, there, everywhere that he could find\\r\\na target.  The librarian “showed off” ­running\\r\\nhither and thither with his arms full of books and\\r\\nmaking a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect\\r\\nauthority delights in.  The young lady teachers\\r\\n“showed off”  ­bending sweetly\\r\\nover pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting\\r\\npretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting\\r\\ngood ones lovingly.  The young gentlemen teachers\\r\\n“showed off” with small scoldings and\\r\\nother little displays of authority and fine attention\\r\\nto discipline ­and most of the teachers,\\r\\nof both sexes, found business up at the library, by\\r\\nthe pulpit; and it was business that frequently had\\r\\nto be done over again two or three times (with much\\r\\nseeming vexation).  The little girls “showed\\r\\noff” in various ways, and the little boys “showed\\r\\noff” with such diligence that the air was thick\\r\\nwith paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. \\r\\nAnd above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic\\r\\njudicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself\\r\\nin the sun of his own grandeur ­for he was\\r\\n“showing off,” too. There was only one thing wanting to\\r\\nmake Mr. Walters’ ecstasy complete, and that\\r\\nwas a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a\\r\\nprodigy.  Several pupils had a few yellow tickets,\\r\\nbut none had enough  ­he had been around\\r\\namong the star pupils inquiring.  He would have\\r\\ngiven worlds, now, to have that German lad back again\\r\\nwith a sound mind. And now at this moment, when hope\\r\\nwas dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with nine yellow\\r\\ntickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and\\r\\ndemanded a Bible.  This was a thunderbolt out of\\r\\na clear sky.  Walters was not expecting an application\\r\\nfrom this source for the next ten years.  But\\r\\nthere was no getting around it ­here were\\r\\nthe certified checks, and they were good for their\\r\\nface.  Tom was therefore elevated to a place with\\r\\nthe Judge and the other elect, and the great news was\\r\\nannounced from headquarters.  It was the most stunning\\r\\nsurprise of the decade, and so profound was the sensation\\r\\nthat it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one’s\\r\\naltitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon\\r\\nin place of one.  The boys were all eaten up with\\r\\nenvy ­but those that suffered the bitterest\\r\\npangs were those who perceived too late that they\\r\\nthemselves had contributed to this hated splendor by\\r\\ntrading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed\\r\\nin selling whitewashing privileges.  These despised\\r\\nthemselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a\\r\\nguileful snake in the grass. The prize was delivered to Tom with\\r\\nas much effusion as the superintendent could pump\\r\\nup under the circumstances; but it lacked somewhat\\r\\nof the true gush, for the poor fellow’s instinct\\r\\ntaught him that there was a mystery here that could\\r\\nnot well bear the light, perhaps; it was simply preposterous\\r\\nthat this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves\\r\\nof Scriptural wisdom on his premises ­a dozen\\r\\nwould strain his capacity, without a doubt. Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and\\r\\nshe tried to make Tom see it in her face ­but\\r\\nhe wouldn’t look.  She wondered; then she\\r\\nwas just a grain troubled; next a dim suspicion came\\r\\nand went ­came again; she watched; a furtive\\r\\nglance told her worlds ­and then her heart\\r\\nbroke, and she was jealous, and angry, and the tears\\r\\ncame and she hated everybody.  Tom most of all\\r\\n(she thought). Tom was introduced to the Judge; but\\r\\nhis tongue was tied, his breath would hardly come,\\r\\nhis heart quaked ­partly because of the awful\\r\\ngreatness of the man, but mainly because he was her\\r\\nparent.  He would have liked to fall down and\\r\\nworship him, if it were in the dark.  The Judge\\r\\nput his hand on Tom’s head and called him a fine\\r\\nlittle man, and asked him what his name was. \\r\\nThe boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:  “Tom.” “Oh, no, not Tom ­it is ­” “Thomas.” “Ah, that’s it.  I\\r\\nthought there was more to it, maybe.  That’s\\r\\nvery well.  But you’ve another one I daresay,\\r\\nand you’ll tell it to me, won’t you?” “Tell the gentleman your other\\r\\nname, Thomas,” said Walters, “and say\\r\\nsir.  You mustn’t forget your manners.” “Thomas Sawyer ­sir.” “That’s it!  That’s\\r\\na good boy.  Fine boy.  Fine, manly little\\r\\nfellow.  Two thousand verses is a great many ­very,\\r\\nvery great many.  And you never can be sorry for\\r\\nthe trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge\\r\\nis worth more than anything there is in the world;\\r\\nit’s what makes great men and good men; you’ll\\r\\nbe a great man and a good man yourself, some day,\\r\\nThomas, and then you’ll look back and say, It’s\\r\\nall owing to the precious Sunday-school privileges\\r\\nof my boyhood ­it’s all owing to my\\r\\ndear teachers that taught me to learn ­it’s\\r\\nall owing to the good superintendent, who encouraged\\r\\nme, and watched over me, and gave me a beautiful Bible ­a\\r\\nsplendid elegant Bible ­to keep and have\\r\\nit all for my own, always ­it’s all\\r\\nowing to right bringing up!  That is what you\\r\\nwill say, Thomas ­and you wouldn’t\\r\\ntake any money for those two thousand verses ­no\\r\\nindeed you wouldn’t.  And now you wouldn’t\\r\\nmind telling me and this lady some of the things you’ve\\r\\nlearned ­no, I know you wouldn’t ­for\\r\\nwe are proud of little boys that learn.  Now, no\\r\\ndoubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples. \\r\\nWon’t you tell us the names of the first two\\r\\nthat were appointed?” Tom was tugging at a button-hole and\\r\\nlooking sheepish.  He blushed, now, and his eyes\\r\\nfell.  Mr. Walters’ heart sank within him. \\r\\nHe said to himself, it is not possible that the boy\\r\\ncan answer the simplest question ­why did\\r\\nthe Judge ask him?  Yet he felt obliged to speak\\r\\nup and say:  “Answer the gentleman, Thomas ­don’t\\r\\nbe afraid.” Tom still hung fire. “Now I know you’ll tell\\r\\nme,” said the lady.  “The names of\\r\\nthe first two disciples were ­” “David and GOLIAH!” Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of\\r\\nthe scene.\n",
       "5 About half-past ten the cracked\\r\\nbell of the small church began to ring, and presently\\r\\nthe people began to gather for the morning sermon. \\r\\nThe Sunday-school children distributed themselves about\\r\\nthe house and occupied pews with their parents, so\\r\\nas to be under supervision.  Aunt Polly came,\\r\\nand Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her ­Tom\\r\\nbeing placed next the aisle, in order that he might\\r\\nbe as far away from the open window and the seductive\\r\\noutside summer scenes as possible.  The crowd\\r\\nfiled up the aisles:  the aged and needy postmaster,\\r\\nwho had seen better days; the mayor and his wife ­for\\r\\nthey had a mayor there, among other unnecessaries;\\r\\nthe justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair,\\r\\nsmart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and\\r\\nwell-to-do, her hill mansion the only palace in the\\r\\ntown, and the most hospitable and much the most lavish\\r\\nin the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could\\r\\nboast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward;\\r\\nlawyer Riverson, the new notable from a distance;\\r\\nnext the belle of the village, followed by a troop\\r\\nof lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers;\\r\\nthen all the young clerks in town in a body ­for\\r\\nthey had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane-heads,\\r\\na circling wall of oiled and simpering admirers, till\\r\\nthe last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all\\r\\ncame the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful\\r\\ncare of his mother as if she were cut glass.  He\\r\\nalways brought his mother to church, and was the pride\\r\\nof all the matrons.  The boys all hated him, he\\r\\nwas so good.  And besides, he had been “thrown\\r\\nup to them” so much.  His white handkerchief\\r\\nwas hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on\\r\\nSundays ­accidentally.  Tom had no handkerchief,\\r\\nand he looked upon boys who had as snobs. The congregation being fully assembled,\\r\\nnow, the bell rang once more, to warn laggards and\\r\\nstragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the church\\r\\nwhich was only broken by the tittering and whispering\\r\\nof the choir in the gallery.  The choir always\\r\\ntittered and whispered all through service.  There\\r\\nwas once a church choir that was not ill-bred, but\\r\\nI have forgotten where it was, now.  It was a great\\r\\nmany years ago, and I can scarcely remember anything\\r\\nabout it, but I think it was in some foreign country. The minister gave out the hymn, and\\r\\nread it through with a relish, in a peculiar style\\r\\nwhich was much admired in that part of the country. \\r\\nHis voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily\\r\\nup till it reached a certain point, where it bore\\r\\nwith strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then\\r\\nplunged down as if from a spring-board:    Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on\\r\\nflow’ry beds of ease,   Whilst others fight to win the prize,\\r\\nand sail thro’ bloody seas? He was regarded as a wonderful reader. \\r\\nAt church “sociables” he was always\\r\\ncalled upon to read poetry; and when he was through,\\r\\nthe ladies would lift up their hands and let them\\r\\nfall helplessly in their laps, and “wall”\\r\\ntheir eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say,\\r\\n“Words cannot express it; it is too beautiful,\\r\\ntoo beautiful for this mortal earth.” After the hymn had been sung, the\\r\\nRev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into a bulletin-board,\\r\\nand read off “notices” of meetings and\\r\\nsocieties and things till it seemed that the list\\r\\nwould stretch out to the crack of doom ­a\\r\\nqueer custom which is still kept up in America, even\\r\\nin cities, away here in this age of abundant newspapers. \\r\\nOften, the less there is to justify a traditional\\r\\ncustom, the harder it is to get rid of it. And now the minister prayed. \\r\\nA good, generous prayer it was, and went into details: \\r\\nit pleaded for the church, and the little children\\r\\nof the church; for the other churches of the village;\\r\\nfor the village itself; for the county; for the State;\\r\\nfor the State officers; for the United States; for\\r\\nthe churches of the United States; for Congress; for\\r\\nthe President; for the officers of the Government;\\r\\nfor poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for the oppressed\\r\\nmillions groaning under the heel of European monarchies\\r\\nand Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light\\r\\nand the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see\\r\\nnor ears to hear withal; for the heathen in the far\\r\\nislands of the sea; and closed with a supplication\\r\\nthat the words he was about to speak might find grace\\r\\nand favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding\\r\\nin time a grateful harvest of good.  Amen. There was a rustling of dresses, and\\r\\nthe standing congregation sat down.  The boy whose\\r\\nhistory this book relates did not enjoy the prayer,\\r\\nhe only endured it ­if he even did that much. \\r\\nHe was restive all through it; he kept tally of the\\r\\ndetails of the prayer, unconsciously  ­for\\r\\nhe was not listening, but he knew the ground of old,\\r\\nand the clergyman’s regular route over it ­and\\r\\nwhen a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,\\r\\nhis ear detected it and his whole nature resented\\r\\nit; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. \\r\\nIn the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back\\r\\nof the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit\\r\\nby calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its\\r\\nhead with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously\\r\\nthat it seemed to almost part company with the body,\\r\\nand the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view;\\r\\nscraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing\\r\\nthem to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going\\r\\nthrough its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew\\r\\nit was perfectly safe.  As indeed it was; for\\r\\nas sorely as Tom’s hands itched to grab for\\r\\nit they did not dare ­he believed his soul\\r\\nwould be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing\\r\\nwhile the prayer was going on.  But with the closing\\r\\nsentence his hand began to curve and steal forward;\\r\\nand the instant the “Amen” was out the\\r\\nfly was a prisoner of war.  His aunt detected\\r\\nthe act and made him let it go. The minister gave out his text and\\r\\ndroned along monotonously through an argument that\\r\\nwas so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod\\r\\n ­and yet it was an argument that dealt in\\r\\nlimitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined\\r\\nelect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth\\r\\nthe saving.  Tom counted the pages of the sermon;\\r\\nafter church he always knew how many pages there had\\r\\nbeen, but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse. \\r\\nHowever, this time he was really interested for a\\r\\nlittle while.  The minister made a grand and moving\\r\\npicture of the assembling together of the world’s\\r\\nhosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb\\r\\nshould lie down together and a little child should\\r\\nlead them.  But the pathos, the lesson, the moral\\r\\nof the great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he\\r\\nonly thought of the conspicuousness of the principal\\r\\ncharacter before the on-looking nations; his face\\r\\nlit with the thought, and he said to himself that he\\r\\nwished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion. Now he lapsed into suffering again,\\r\\nas the dry argument was resumed.  Presently he\\r\\nbethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. \\r\\nIt was a large black beetle with formidable jaws ­a\\r\\n“pinchbug,” he called it.  It was\\r\\nin a percussion-cap box.  The first thing the beetle\\r\\ndid was to take him by the finger.  A natural\\r\\nfillip followed, the beetle went floundering into\\r\\nthe aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger\\r\\nwent into the boy’s mouth.  The beetle lay\\r\\nthere working its helpless legs, unable to turn over. \\r\\nTom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out\\r\\nof his reach.  Other people uninterested in the\\r\\nsermon found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it\\r\\ntoo.  Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling\\r\\nalong, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness\\r\\nand the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. \\r\\nHe spied the beetle; the drooping tail lifted and\\r\\nwagged.  He surveyed the prize; walked around\\r\\nit; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around\\r\\nit again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then\\r\\nlifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just\\r\\nmissing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy\\r\\nthe diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle\\r\\nbetween his paws, and continued his experiments; grew\\r\\nweary at last, and then indifferent and absent-minded. \\r\\nHis head nodded, and little by little his chin descended\\r\\nand touched the enemy, who seized it.  There was\\r\\na sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle’s head, and\\r\\nthe beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit on\\r\\nits back once more.  The neighboring spectators\\r\\nshook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went\\r\\nbehind fans and handkerchiefs, and Tom was entirely\\r\\nhappy.  The dog looked foolish, and probably felt\\r\\nso; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and\\r\\na craving for revenge.  So he went to the beetle\\r\\nand began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it\\r\\nfrom every point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws\\r\\nwithin an inch of the creature, making even closer\\r\\nsnatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head\\r\\ntill his ears flapped again.  But he grew tired\\r\\nonce more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with\\r\\na fly but found no relief; followed an ant around,\\r\\nwith his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied\\r\\nof that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely,\\r\\nand sat down on it.  Then there was a wild yelp\\r\\nof agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle;\\r\\nthe yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed\\r\\nthe house in front of the altar; he flew down the\\r\\nother aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored\\r\\nup the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress,\\r\\ntill presently he was but a woolly comet moving in\\r\\nits orbit with the gleam and the speed of light. \\r\\nAt last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course,\\r\\nand sprang into its master’s lap; he flung it\\r\\nout of the window, and the voice of distress quickly\\r\\nthinned away and died in the distance. By this time the whole church was\\r\\nred-faced and suffocating with suppressed laughter,\\r\\nand the sermon had come to a dead standstill. \\r\\nThe discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame\\r\\nand halting, all possibility of impressiveness being\\r\\nat an end; for even the gravest sentiments were constantly\\r\\nbeing received with a smothered burst of unholy mirth,\\r\\nunder cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor\\r\\nparson had said a rarely facetious thing.  It was\\r\\na genuine relief to the whole congregation when the\\r\\nordeal was over and the benediction pronounced. Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful,\\r\\nthinking to himself that there was some satisfaction\\r\\nabout divine service when there was a bit of variety\\r\\nin it.  He had but one marring thought; he was\\r\\nwilling that the dog should play with his pinchbug,\\r\\nbut he did not think it was upright in him to carry\\r\\nit off.

       "6 Monday morning found Tom Sawyer\\r\\nmiserable.  Monday morning always found him so ­because\\r\\nit began another week’s slow suffering in school. \\r\\nHe generally began that day with wishing he had had\\r\\nno intervening holiday, it made the going into captivity\\r\\nand fetters again so much more odious. Tom lay thinking.  Presently it\\r\\noccurred to him that he wished he was sick; then he\\r\\ncould stay home from school.  Here was a vague\\r\\npossibility.  He canvassed his system.  No\\r\\nailment was found, and he investigated again. \\r\\nThis time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms,\\r\\nand he began to encourage them with considerable hope. \\r\\nBut they soon grew feeble, and presently died wholly\\r\\naway.  He reflected further.  Suddenly he\\r\\ndiscovered something.  One of his upper front teeth\\r\\nwas loose.  This was lucky; he was about to begin\\r\\nto groan, as a “starter,” as he called\\r\\nit, when it occurred to him that if he came into court\\r\\nwith that argument, his aunt would pull it out, and\\r\\nthat would hurt.  So he thought he would hold\\r\\nthe tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further. \\r\\nNothing offered for some little time, and then he\\r\\nremembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain\\r\\nthing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks\\r\\nand threatened to make him lose a finger.  So\\r\\nthe boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet\\r\\nand held it up for inspection.  But now he did\\r\\nnot know the necessary symptoms.  However, it\\r\\nseemed well worth while to chance it, so he fell to\\r\\ngroaning with considerable spirit. But Sid slept on unconscious. Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel\\r\\npain in the toe. No result from Sid. Tom was panting with his exertions\\r\\nby this time.  He took a rest and then swelled\\r\\nhimself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans. Sid snored on. Tom was aggravated.  He said,\\r\\n“Sid, Sid!” and shook him.  This course\\r\\nworked well, and Tom began to groan again.  Sid\\r\\nyawned, stretched, then brought himself up on his\\r\\nelbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom. \\r\\nTom went on groaning.  Sid said:  “Tom!  Say, Tom!”\\r\\n[No response.] “Here, Tom!  Tom! \\r\\nWhat is the matter, Tom?” And he shook him and\\r\\nlooked in his face anxiously. Tom moaned out:  “Oh, don’t, Sid.  Don’t joggle\\r\\nme.” “Why, what’s the matter, Tom?  I must\\r\\ncall auntie.” “No ­never mind.  It’ll\\r\\nbe over by and by, maybe.  Don’t call anybody.” “But I must!  Don’t\\r\\ngroan so, Tom, it’s awful.  How long you\\r\\nbeen this way?” “Hours.  Ouch!  Oh, don’t stir\\r\\nso, Sid, you’ll kill me.” “Tom, why didn’t you wake\\r\\nme sooner?  Oh, Tom, don’t!  It\\r\\nmakes my flesh crawl to hear you.  Tom, what is\\r\\nthe matter?” “I forgive you everything, Sid.\\r\\n[Groan.] Everything you’ve ever done to me. \\r\\nWhen I’m gone ­” “Oh, Tom, you ain’t dying,\\r\\nare you?  Don’t, Tom ­oh, don’t. \\r\\nMaybe ­” “I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.]\\r\\nTell ’em so, Sid.  And Sid, you give my\\r\\nwindow-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl\\r\\nthat’s come to town, and tell her ­” But Sid had snatched his clothes and\\r\\ngone.  Tom was suffering in reality, now, so handsomely\\r\\nwas his imagination working, and so his groans had\\r\\ngathered quite a genuine tone. Sid flew down-stairs and said:  “Oh, Aunt Polly, come!  Tom’s dying!” “Dying!” “Yes’m.  Don’t wait ­come\\r\\nquick!” “Rubbage!  I don’t believe it!” But she fled up-stairs, nevertheless,\\r\\nwith Sid and Mary at her heels.  And her face\\r\\ngrew white, too, and her lip trembled.  When she\\r\\nreached the bedside she gasped out:  “You, Tom!  Tom, what’s the matter\\r\\nwith you?” “Oh, auntie, I’m ­” “What’s the matter with you ­what\\r\\nis the matter with you, child?” “Oh, auntie, my sore toe’s mortified!” The old lady sank down into a chair\\r\\nand laughed a little, then cried a little, then did\\r\\nboth together.  This restored her and she said:  “Tom, what a turn you did give\\r\\nme.  Now you shut up that nonsense and climb out\\r\\nof this.” The groans ceased and the pain vanished\\r\\nfrom the toe.  The boy felt a little foolish,\\r\\nand he said:  “Aunt Polly, it seemed\\r\\nmortified, and it hurt so I never minded my tooth\\r\\nat all.” “Your tooth, indeed!  What’s the matter\\r\\nwith your tooth?” “One of them’s loose, and it aches perfectly\\r\\nawful.” “There, there, now, don’t\\r\\nbegin that groaning again.  Open your mouth. \\r\\nWell ­your tooth is loose, but you’re\\r\\nnot going to die about that.  Mary, get me a silk\\r\\nthread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.” Tom said:  “Oh, please, auntie, don’t\\r\\npull it out.  It don’t hurt any more. \\r\\nI wish I may never stir if it does.  Please don’t,\\r\\nauntie.  I don’t want to stay home from\\r\\nschool.” “Oh, you don’t, don’t\\r\\nyou?  So all this row was because you thought\\r\\nyou’d get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? \\r\\nTom, Tom, I love you so, and you seem to try every\\r\\nway you can to break my old heart with your outrageousness.” \\r\\nBy this time the dental instruments were ready. \\r\\nThe old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to\\r\\nTom’s tooth with a loop and tied the other to\\r\\nthe bedpost.  Then she seized the chunk of fire\\r\\nand suddenly thrust it almost into the boy’s\\r\\nface.  The tooth hung dangling by the bedpost,\\r\\nnow. But all trials bring their compensations. \\r\\nAs Tom wended to school after breakfast, he was the\\r\\nenvy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper\\r\\nrow of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and\\r\\nadmirable way.  He gathered quite a following of\\r\\nlads interested in the exhibition; and one that had\\r\\ncut his finger and had been a centre of fascination\\r\\nand homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly\\r\\nwithout an adherent, and shorn of his glory.  His\\r\\nheart was heavy, and he said with a disdain which\\r\\nhe did not feel that it wasn’t anything to spit\\r\\nlike Tom Sawyer; but another boy said, “Sour\\r\\ngrapes!” and he wandered away a dismantled hero. Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile\\r\\npariah of the village, Huckleberry Finn, son of the\\r\\ntown drunkard.  Huckleberry was cordially hated\\r\\nand dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because\\r\\nhe was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad ­and\\r\\nbecause all their children admired him so, and delighted\\r\\nin his forbidden society, and wished they dared to\\r\\nbe like him.  Tom was like the rest of the respectable\\r\\nboys, in that he envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast\\r\\ncondition, and was under strict orders not to play\\r\\nwith him.  So he played with him every time he\\r\\ngot a chance.  Huckleberry was always dressed\\r\\nin the cast-off clothes of full-grown men, and they\\r\\nwere in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. \\r\\nHis hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped\\r\\nout of its brim; his coat, when he wore one, hung\\r\\nnearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far\\r\\ndown the back; but one suspender supported his trousers;\\r\\nthe seat of the trousers bagged low and contained\\r\\nnothing, the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when\\r\\nnot rolled up. Huckleberry came and went, at his\\r\\nown free will.  He slept on doorsteps in fine\\r\\nweather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have\\r\\nto go to school or to church, or call any being master\\r\\nor obey anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when\\r\\nand where he chose, and stay as long as it suited\\r\\nhim; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as\\r\\nlate as he pleased; he was always the first boy that\\r\\nwent barefoot in the spring and the last to resume\\r\\nleather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put\\r\\non clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. \\r\\nIn a word, everything that goes to make life precious\\r\\nthat boy had.  So thought every harassed, hampered,\\r\\nrespectable boy in St. Petersburg. Tom hailed the romantic outcast:  “Hello, Huckleberry!” “Hello yourself, and see how you like it.” “What’s that you got?” “Dead cat.” “Lemme see him, Huck.  My, he’s pretty\\r\\nstiff.  Where’d you get him?” “Bought him off’n a boy.” “What did you give?” “I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got\\r\\nat the slaughter-house.” “Where’d you get the blue ticket?” “Bought it off’n Ben Rogers two weeks\\r\\nago for a hoop-stick.” “Say ­what is dead cats good for,\\r\\nHuck?” “Good for?  Cure warts with.” “No!  Is that so?  I know something\\r\\nthat’s better.” “I bet you don’t.  What is it?” “Why, spunk-water.” “Spunk-water!  I wouldn’t give a dern\\r\\nfor spunk-water.” “You wouldn’t, wouldn’t you? \\r\\nD’you ever try it?” “No, I hain’t.  But Bob Tanner did.” “Who told you so!” “Why, he told Jeff Thatcher,\\r\\nand Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny told Jim Hollis,\\r\\nand Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and\\r\\nthe nigger told me.  There now!” “Well, what of it?  They’ll\\r\\nall lie.  Leastways all but the nigger.  I\\r\\ndon’t know him.  But I never see a nigger\\r\\nthat wouldn’t lie.  Shucks!  Now\\r\\nyou tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.” “Why, he took and dipped his\\r\\nhand in a rotten stump where the rain-water was.” “In the daytime?” “Certainly.” “With his face to the stump?” “Yes.  Least I reckon so.” “Did he say anything?” “I don’t reckon he did.  I don’t\\r\\nknow.” “Aha!  Talk about trying\\r\\nto cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool way\\r\\nas that!  Why, that ain’t a-going to do any\\r\\ngood.  You got to go all by yourself, to the middle\\r\\nof the woods, where you know there’s a spunk-water\\r\\nstump, and just as it’s midnight you back up\\r\\nagainst the stump and jam your hand in and say:    ’Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal\\r\\nshorts,\\r\\n   Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller\\r\\nthese warts,’ and then walk away quick, eleven steps,\\r\\nwith your eyes shut, and then turn around three times\\r\\nand walk home without speaking to anybody.  Because\\r\\nif you speak the charm’s busted.” “Well, that sounds like a good\\r\\nway; but that ain’t the way Bob Tanner done.” “No, sir, you can bet he didn’t,\\r\\nbecuz he’s the wartiest boy in this town; and\\r\\nhe wouldn’t have a wart on him if he’d\\r\\nknowed how to work spunk-water.  I’ve took\\r\\noff thousands of warts off of my hands that way, Huck. \\r\\nI play with frogs so much that I’ve always got\\r\\nconsiderable many warts.  Sometimes I take ’em\\r\\noff with a bean.” “Yes, bean’s good.  I’ve done\\r\\nthat.” “Have you?  What’s your way?” “You take and split the bean,\\r\\nand cut the wart so as to get some blood, and then\\r\\nyou put the blood on one piece of the bean and take\\r\\nand dig a hole and bury it ’bout midnight at\\r\\nthe crossroads in the dark of the moon, and then you\\r\\nburn up the rest of the bean.  You see that piece\\r\\nthat’s got the blood on it will keep drawing\\r\\nand drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it,\\r\\nand so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and\\r\\npretty soon off she comes.” “Yes, that’s it, Huck ­that’s\\r\\nit; though when you’re burying it if you say\\r\\n‘Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother\\r\\nme!’ it’s better.  That’s the\\r\\nway Joe Harper does, and he’s been nearly to\\r\\nCoonville and most everywheres.  But say ­how\\r\\ndo you cure ’em with dead cats?” “Why, you take your cat and\\r\\ngo and get in the graveyard ’long about midnight\\r\\nwhen somebody that was wicked has been buried; and\\r\\nwhen it’s midnight a devil will come, or maybe\\r\\ntwo or three, but you can’t see ’em, you\\r\\ncan only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear\\r\\n’em talk; and when they’re taking that\\r\\nfeller away, you heave your cat after ’em and\\r\\nsay, ’Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil,\\r\\nwarts follow cat, I’m done with ye!’ That’ll\\r\\nfetch any wart.” “Sounds right.  D’you ever try it,\\r\\nHuck?” “No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.” “Well, I reckon it’s so, then.  Becuz\\r\\nthey say she’s a witch.” “Say!  Why, Tom, I know\\r\\nshe is.  She witched pap.  Pap says so his\\r\\nown self.  He come along one day, and he see she\\r\\nwas a-witching him, so he took up a rock, and if she\\r\\nhadn’t dodged, he’d a got her.  Well,\\r\\nthat very night he rolled off’n a shed wher’\\r\\nhe was a layin drunk, and broke his arm.” “Why, that’s awful.  How did he know\\r\\nshe was a-witching him?” “Lord, pap can tell, easy. \\r\\nPap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy,\\r\\nthey’re a-witching you.  Specially if they\\r\\nmumble.  Becuz when they mumble they’re\\r\\nsaying the Lord’s Prayer backards.” “Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?” “To-night.  I reckon they’ll come\\r\\nafter old Hoss Williams to-night.” “But they buried him Saturday.  Didn’t\\r\\nthey get him Saturday night?” “Why, how you talk!  How\\r\\ncould their charms work till midnight? ­and\\r\\nthen it’s Sunday.  Devils don’t\\r\\nslosh around much of a Sunday, I don’t reckon.” “I never thought of that.  That’s\\r\\nso.  Lemme go with you?” “Of course ­if you ain’t afeard.” “Afeard!  ’Tain’t likely. \\r\\nWill you meow?” “Yes ­and you meow\\r\\nback, if you get a chance.  Last time, you kep’\\r\\nme a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing\\r\\nrocks at me and says ‘Dern that cat!’\\r\\nand so I hove a brick through his window ­but\\r\\ndon’t you tell.” “I won’t.  I couldn’t\\r\\nmeow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but\\r\\nI’ll meow this time.  Say ­what’s\\r\\nthat?” “Nothing but a tick.” “Where’d you get him?” “Out in the woods.” “What’ll you take for him?” “I don’t know.  I don’t want\\r\\nto sell him.” “All right.  It’s a mighty small tick,\\r\\nanyway.” “Oh, anybody can run a tick\\r\\ndown that don’t belong to them.  I’m\\r\\nsatisfied with it.  It’s a good enough tick\\r\\nfor me.” “Sho, there’s ticks a\\r\\nplenty.  I could have a thousand of ’em if\\r\\nI wanted to.” “Well, why don’t you? \\r\\nBecuz you know mighty well you can’t.  This\\r\\nis a pretty early tick, I reckon.  It’s\\r\\nthe first one I’ve seen this year.” “Say, Huck ­I’ll give you my\\r\\ntooth for him.” “Less see it.” Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully\\r\\nunrolled it.  Huckleberry viewed it wistfully. \\r\\nThe temptation was very strong.  At last he said:  “Is it genuwyne?” Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy. “Well, all right,” said Huckleberry, “it’s\\r\\na trade.” Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap\\r\\nbox that had lately been the pinchbug’s prison,\\r\\nand the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than\\r\\nbefore. When Tom reached the little isolated\\r\\nframe schoolhouse, he strode in briskly, with the\\r\\nmanner of one who had come with all honest speed. \\r\\nHe hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his\\r\\nseat with business-like alacrity.  The master,\\r\\nthroned on high in his great splint-bottom arm-chair,\\r\\nwas dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. \\r\\nThe interruption roused him. “Thomas Sawyer!” Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full,\\r\\nit meant trouble. “Sir!” “Come up here.  Now, sir, why are you late\\r\\nagain, as usual?” Tom was about to take refuge in a\\r\\nlie, when he saw two long tails of yellow hair hanging\\r\\ndown a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy\\r\\nof love; and by that form was the only vacant\\r\\nplace on the girls’ side of the schoolhouse. \\r\\nHe instantly said:  “I stopped to talk with\\r\\nHuckleberry Finn!” The master’s pulse stood still,\\r\\nand he stared helplessly.  The buzz of study ceased. \\r\\nThe pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost\\r\\nhis mind.  The master said:  “You ­you did what?” “Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.” There was no mistaking the words. “Thomas Sawyer, this is the\\r\\nmost astounding confession I have ever listened to. \\r\\nNo mere ferule will answer for this offence.  Take\\r\\noff your jacket.” The master’s arm performed until\\r\\nit was tired and the stock of switches notably diminished. \\r\\nThen the order followed:  “Now, sir, go and sit with the girls!  And\\r\\nlet this be a warning to you.” The titter that rippled around the\\r\\nroom appeared to abash the boy, but in reality that\\r\\nresult was caused rather more by his worshipful awe\\r\\nof his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay\\r\\nin his high good fortune.  He sat down upon the\\r\\nend of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself\\r\\naway from him with a toss of her head.  Nudges\\r\\nand winks and whispers traversed the room, but Tom\\r\\nsat still, with his arms upon the long, low desk before\\r\\nhim, and seemed to study his book. By and by attention ceased from him,\\r\\nand the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull\\r\\nair once more.  Presently the boy began to steal\\r\\nfurtive glances at the girl.  She observed it,\\r\\n“made a mouth” at him and gave him the\\r\\nback of her head for the space of a minute.  When\\r\\nshe cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before\\r\\nher.  She thrust it away.  Tom gently put\\r\\nit back.  She thrust it away again, but with less\\r\\nanimosity.  Tom patiently returned it to its place. \\r\\nThen she let it remain.  Tom scrawled on his slate,\\r\\n“Please take it ­I got more.” \\r\\nThe girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. \\r\\nNow the boy began to draw something on the slate,\\r\\nhiding his work with his left hand.  For a time\\r\\nthe girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity\\r\\npresently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible\\r\\nsigns.  The boy worked on, apparently unconscious. \\r\\nThe girl made a sort of noncommittal attempt to see,\\r\\nbut the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. \\r\\nAt last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered:  “Let me see it.” Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature\\r\\nof a house with two gable ends to it and a corkscrew\\r\\nof smoke issuing from the chimney.  Then the girl’s\\r\\ninterest began to fasten itself upon the work and she\\r\\nforgot everything else.  When it was finished,\\r\\nshe gazed a moment, then whispered:  “It’s nice ­make a man.” The artist erected a man in the front\\r\\nyard, that resembled a derrick.  He could have\\r\\nstepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;\\r\\nshe was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:  “It’s a beautiful man ­now make\\r\\nme coming along.” Tom drew an hour-glass with a full\\r\\nmoon and straw limbs to it and armed the spreading\\r\\nfingers with a portentous fan.  The girl said:  “It’s ever so nice ­I wish I\\r\\ncould draw.” “It’s easy,” whispered Tom, “I’ll\\r\\nlearn you.” “Oh, will you?  When?” “At noon.  Do you go home to dinner?” “I’ll stay if you will.” “Good ­that’s a whack. \\r\\nWhat’s your name?” “Becky Thatcher.  What’s yours? \\r\\nOh, I know.  It’s Thomas Sawyer.” “That’s the name they\\r\\nlick me by.  I’m Tom when I’m good. \\r\\nYou call me Tom, will you?” “Yes.” Now Tom began to scrawl something\\r\\non the slate, hiding the words from the girl. \\r\\nBut she was not backward this time.  She begged\\r\\nto see.  Tom said:  “Oh, it ain’t anything.” “Yes it is.” “No it ain’t.  You don’t want\\r\\nto see.” “Yes I do, indeed I do.  Please let me.” “You’ll tell.” “No I won’t ­deed and deed and\\r\\ndouble deed won’t.” “You won’t tell anybody at all?  Ever,\\r\\nas long as you live?” “No, I won’t ever tell ANYbody.  Now\\r\\nlet me.” “Oh, you don’t want to see!” “Now that you treat me so, I\\r\\nwill see.”  And she put her small hand\\r\\nupon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending\\r\\nto resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by\\r\\ndegrees till these words were revealed:  “I\\r\\nlove you.” “Oh, you bad thing!” And\\r\\nshe hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and looked\\r\\npleased, nevertheless. Just at this juncture the boy felt\\r\\na slow, fateful grip closing on his ear, and a steady\\r\\nlifting impulse.  In that wise he was borne across\\r\\nthe house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering\\r\\nfire of giggles from the whole school.  Then the\\r\\nmaster stood over him during a few awful moments,\\r\\nand finally moved away to his throne without saying\\r\\na word.  But although Tom’s ear tingled,\\r\\nhis heart was jubilant. As the school quieted down Tom made\\r\\nan honest effort to study, but the turmoil within\\r\\nhim was too great.  In turn he took his place in\\r\\nthe reading class and made a botch of it; then in\\r\\nthe geography class and turned lakes into mountains,\\r\\nmountains into rivers, and rivers into continents,\\r\\ntill chaos was come again; then in the spelling class,\\r\\nand got “turned down,” by a succession\\r\\nof mere baby words, till he brought up at the foot\\r\\nand yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with\\r\\nostentation for months.
