Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 1986 edition featured 4 parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to 5 players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to 5 players and adds a shorter 5 round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Die Macher is #1 in the Valley Games Classic Line&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic159509.jpg </td><td>5</td><td>240</td><td>14</td><td>3</td><td>240</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Die Macher        </span></td><td>240</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Marcus Gschwendtner        </span></td><td>Economic,Negotiation,Political</td><td>NA</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Karl-Heinz Schmiel   </span></td><td>NA</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Country: Germany,Valley Games Classic Line                   </span></td><td>Area Control / Area Influence,Auction/Bidding,Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Simultaneous Action Selection</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Hans im Glück Verlags-GmbH,Moskito Spiele,Valley Games, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                           </span></td><td>7.66508</td><td> 4498</td></tr>\n",

After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if &amp;quot;first&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;last&amp;quot; is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands.

Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The 1986 edition featured 4 parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to 5 players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.

The game is over when the Pharoah's Pyramid in the center is completed, which is built using all the blocks that the players don't use during the course of the game.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Final round 1990 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic285299.jpg  & 4 &  60 & 12 & 2 &  60 & Tal der Könige     &  60 & ... & NA                          & Ancient                        & NA & Christian Beierer     & NA & Country: Egypt,Promotional Board Games                        & Action Point Allowance System,Area Control / Area Influence,Auction/Bidding,Set Collection               & KOSMOS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  & 6.60675 &   314\\\\\n",

       "| 1 | Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 1986 edition featured 4 parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to 5 players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.

Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if &amp;quot;first&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;last&amp;quot; is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands.

       "1 Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The 1986 edition featured 4 parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to 5 players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to 5 players and adds a shorter 5 round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&#10;&#10;Die Macher is #1 in the Valley Games Classic Line&#10;&#10;\n",
       "2 Dragonmaster is a trick-taking card game based on an older game called Coup d'etat. Each player is given a supply of plastic gems, which represent points. Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if &quot;first&quot; or &quot;last&quot; is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands. At the end, the biggest pile of gems wins the game.&#10;&#10;Jewel contents:&#10;&#10;11 clear (3 extra)&#10;13 green (1 extra)&#10;22 red (2 extra)&#10;22 blue (2 extra)&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "3 Part of the Knizia tile-laying trilogy, Samurai is set in medieval Japan. Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha tokens scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions &mdash; or all three at once! Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each token (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group.&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four tokens have been removed from play due to a tie for influence.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types. Ties are not uncommon and are broken based on the number of other, &quot;non-majority&quot; symbols each player has collected.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "4 When you see the triangular box and the luxurious, large blocks, you can tell this game was designed to be beautiful as well as functional.  The object of the game is to build pyramids out of the different colored blocks.  A pyramid scores more points when it's made from a few colors, but it's much harder to consistently outbid the other players for the necessary blocks.  The game is over when the Pharoah's Pyramid in the center is completed, which is built using all the blocks that the players don't use during the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Final round 1990 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.

       "\t<tr><td> 1</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 1986 edition featured 4 parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to 5 players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to 5 players and adds a shorter 5 round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Die Macher is #1 in the Valley Games Classic

       "\t<tr><td> 2</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Dragonmaster is a trick-taking card game based on an older game called Coup d'etat. Each player is given a supply of plastic gems, which represent points. Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if &amp;quot;first&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;last&amp;quot; is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands. At the end, the biggest pile of gems wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Jewel contents:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;11 clear (3 extra)&amp;#10;13 green (1 extra)&amp;#10;22 red (2 extra)&amp;#10;22 blue (2 extra)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic184174.jpg </td><td> 4</td><td> 30</td><td>12</td><td>3</td><td> 30</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Dragonmaster               </span></td><td> 30</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Bob Pepper                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Card Game,Fantasy                                                           </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                             </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>G.

       "\t<tr><td> 3</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Part of the Knizia tile-laying trilogy, Samurai is set in medieval Japan. Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha tokens scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions &amp;mdash; or all three at once! Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each token (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four tokens have been removed from play due to a tie for influence.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types.

The object of the game is to build pyramids out of the different colored blocks.  A pyramid scores more points when it's made from a few colors, but it's much harder to consistently outbid the other players for the necessary blocks.  The game is over when the Pharoah's Pyramid in the center is completed, which is built using all the blocks that the players don't use during the course of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Final round 1990

As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher.  Some versions of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note: many books and websites list this as a 1962 publication. This is incorrect; information from Sid Sackson's diaries, correspondence, and royalty statements prove that it was published in 1964.  However, for some reason admins continue to accept &amp;quot;corrections&amp;quot; of the publication date to 1962.

The pieces are in the shapes of buildings, covering from one to five square units. The first player takes the single neutral Cathedral piece and places it onto the board. Players then alternate placing one of their buildings onto the board until neither player can place another building. Players capture territory by surrounding areas that are occupied by at most one opponent or neutral building. A captured piece is removed and captured territory becomes off-limits to the opponent. The player with the fewest 'square units' of buildings that can't be placed wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic181642.jpg </td><td> 2</td><td> 20</td><td> 8</td><td>2</td><td> 20</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Cathedral                  </span></td><td> 20</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>S.

       "\t<tr><td> 8</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>In this interesting offering from Warfrog, players become Gods seeking to dominate a world with their followers.  The first part of the game involves constructing the game board, after which players take turns using cards to determine how many new people should appear and what type of terrain they will inhabit.  All tribes start off as barbarians, but soon the calming effect of civilization settles the marauding bands; although civilized tribes score more, they can no longer attack.  What they can do, though, is civilize other players' followers.

Players slowly explore the islands &amp;ndash; by picking and placing land tiles that are most favorable to them &amp;ndash; and discover wealth in the form of gold and fish. As they learn about the land and sea areas of this new land, they position their caballeros to try to maintain control of the important regions. Castillos give them a measure of protection from others, and ships allow them to establish trade and to fish for food. Success is measured in the size of land and sea areas they control. Their success is measured twice, and in the end these scores are summed and the winner declared.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;

       "\t<tr><td>10</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1798136.jpg</td><td> 6</td><td> 60</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td> 60</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Elfenland                  </span></td><td> 60</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Doris Matthäus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Fantasy,Travel                                                              </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                             </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Alan R.

To help players match their cards up, the game features extensive trading and deal making.  One of the most unique features of the game is that you cannot rearrange your hand, as you need to play the cards in the order that you draw them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box.  One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean.  This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic69366.jpg  </span></td><td> 7</td><td> 45</td><td>13</td><td>2</td><td> 45</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Bohnanza                   </span></td><td> 45</td><td>...</td><td>Fréderic Bertrand,Marek Bláha,Andrea Boekhoff,Klemens Franz,Oliver Freudenreich,Inge George,Guido Hoffmann,Alexander Jung,Harald Lieske,Atelier Löwentor,Doris Matthäus,Björn Pertoft,Uwe Rosenberg,Johann Rüttinger,Barbara Stachuletz,Franz Vohwinkel,Markus Wagner</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Card Game,Farming,Negotiation                                               </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                             </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Uwe Rosenberg                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Auf der schwäb'schen Eisenbohn,Bohn Camillo,Bohnanza Erweiterungs-Set,Bohnanza Erweiterungs-Set (Revised Edition),Bohnanza: Amigo Bohnentaler,Bohnanza: Bean Market,Bohnanza: Bohnaparte &amp;

       "\t<tr><td>12</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.  Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns).  Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs.  Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.  The game lasts for three &amp;quot;epochs&amp;quot; (rounds).  The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the Box:&amp;#10;The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!&amp;#10;The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people.

       "\t<tr><td>13</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>In Catan (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)&amp;mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone&amp;mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&amp;mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2419375.jpg</td><td> 4</td><td>120</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td> 60</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Catan                      </span></td><td>120</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Volkan Baga,Tanja Donner,Pete Fenlon,Jason Hawkins,Michaela Kienle,Harald Lieske,Michael Menzel,Marion Pott,Matt Schwabel,Franz Vohwinkel,Stephen Graham Walsh                                                                                                       </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Negotiation                                                                 </span></td><td>CATAN 3D Collector's Edition,Catan: Big Box,Catan: Big Box,The Settlers of Catan: 15th Anniversary Wood Edition</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Klaus Teuber                                       </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>20 Jahre Darmstadt Spielt,Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015,Catakatoa,Catan Austria / Wien meets Catan,Catan Geographies: Austria,Catan Geographies: Bayern Edition,Catan Geographies: Corsica,Catan Geographies: Georgia,Catan Geographies: Kennessee,Catan Geographies: Mallorca,Catan Geographies: North Rhine – Westphalia,Catan Geographies: Settlers of Hesse,Catan Länderszenarien: Polen,Catan Länderszenarien: Rickshaw Run,Catan Scenarios: Big Game Big Honor,Catan Scenarios: Catanimals,Catan Scenarios: Frenemies,Catan Scenarios: Helpers of Catan,Catan Scenarios: Oil Springs,Catan Scenarios: Santa Claus,Catan World Championship Berlin 2014 Special,Catan: 5-6 Player Extension,Catan: 999 Games 25 jaar Expansion,Catan: Catan Day 2015 Exclusive Expansion,Catan: Cities &amp;

       "\t<tr><td>14</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Basari is a game of gem merchants competing in a marketplace&amp;quot;: racing, collecting, trading, and predicting what the other merchants will do.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To start the game, players receive 12 gemstones (3 each of 4 colors). &amp;#10;Each turn there will be a movement phase and an action phase:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For movement, everyone simultaneously rolls their die and moves their markers around a track.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;They then choose one of three different actions to perform. The actions are:&amp;#10;- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, &amp;#10;- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or &amp;#10;- to roll and move again and also collect points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Re-implemented by:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Edel, Stein &amp; Reich&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic48605.jpg  </span></td><td> 4</td><td> 25</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td> 25</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Basari                     </span></td><td> 25</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>John Kovalic,Lüders &amp;

Each edition is the same game at its core, but the features, compatible expansions, and production differ among them. This entry is for the original 1977 Eon version.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players represent alien races that are seeking to spread themselves onto five foreign worlds.  To accomplish this, they make challenges against other players and enlist the aid of interested parties.  But alien powers, which are unique to each race, give players ways to bend or outright break some rule in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game continues until one player occupies five planets in other systems to win.

       "\t<tr><td>17</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>This game gained a quick following after one of the major gaming conventions of 1999.  It features several characters, represented on actual stickpin buttons, that each have a unique allowance of polyhedral dice.  These dice endow each  character with fairly unique combat abilities.  Players roll the dice against each other and take their opponents' dice as casualties.  The object of the game is take out the most die 'sides' during the combat.  It's quite simple, quite inventive, and deeper than it would seem at first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic59279.jpg  </span></td><td> 2</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  5</span></td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  5</span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Button Men                 </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  5</span></td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Pete Abrams,Gerald Brom,Larry Elmore,Phil Foglio,Ryan Kinnaird,John Kovalic,John Nephew,Michelle Nephew,Brian Snoddy,Cheyenne Wright,Andrew Yates                                                                                                                    </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Collectible Components,Dice,Fighting,Print &amp;

They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &amp;quot;registers&amp;quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;

       "\t<tr><td>19</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing).  Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr&amp;uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp;amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &amp;quot;Wacky Water!&amp;quot; &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &amp;quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&amp;quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tiles-perhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;

       "\t<tr><td>20</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>In this game of science fiction strip mining, players land on a planet and try and grab as much ore as possible and take off before the game is over.  Each player has tanks, boats, barges, mining equipment and a base ship at his disposal and will have to contend with the weather and the other miners.  The game uses an action point allowance system and thus is dice free.  Each player on his turn has a pool of points that he can divide in a variety of ways, putting all the points into one unit's movement or dividing them among several units.  Each turn is timed so players have to think quickly, and once a move has been made it cannot be retracted.  The game itself is beautifully put together, with a detailed hex grid and real metal miniatures for all of the units.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Online Play: &amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Full Metal Galaxy&amp;#10;

       "\t<tr><td>22</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>From the 2nd edition rulebook intro for MAGIC REALM:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MAGIC REALM is a game of fantasy adventuring, set in a land filled with monsters, fabulous treasures, great warriors, and magicians. The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.&amp;#10;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.&amp;#10;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9&amp;#10;&amp;#10;See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic148345.jpg </td><td>16</td><td>240</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>240</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Magic Realm                </span></td><td>240</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>George Goebel,Kim Grommel,Richard Hamblen,Randall C.

Although all cards will turn up somewhere during the game, the timing and position in which they will be played is crucial and will ensure a different game every time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The main goal of each city-state is to gain points in the form of technical advances, while keeping their culture's misery level as low as possible. The payout structure is similar to those of Civilization and Advanced Civilization in that more resources of the same type yield increasingly higher payouts. This time particular payouts are triggered by card play for every player at once. An ingenious and very smooth working &amp;ldquo;combat&amp;rdquo; system is implemented to determine province &amp;ndash; and thus resource - control.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;

       "\t<tr><td>30</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>An epic fantasy quest to recover an ancient magic scepter from a tyrant king in his Dark Tower, brought to life in electronic form.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To vanquish the usurper, players search the four realms of the circular game board for three keys to unlock the tower's gate.  On this journey, there are battles to be fought against roving bands of brigands, dragons, plague and hunger.  There are bazaars to visit to purchase supplies and assistants for the quest.  There are uncharted territories to get lost in and tombs and ruins to plunder.  And there is a mighty army to be raised before the player can lay seige to the tower and fight either to glorious victory or crushing defeat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dated and primitive by today's standards, Dark Tower was nevertheless an astonishing achievement when it was released in 1981.  Every aspect of the game was monitored by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself, an unheard of innovation at the time.  Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors.

Each player must expand their personal maps to maximize their scoring possibilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Manipulating your position in the player order is crucial for mastering Honshu.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3311364.jpg</td><td>5</td><td> 40</td><td> 8</td><td>2</td><td>30</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Honshu                                                                    </span></td><td> 40</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Ossi Hiekkala,Jere Kasanen                               </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Card Game,City Building                                       </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Kalle Malmioja                                                         </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Asian Theme,Country: Japan                                                             </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Hand Management,Tile Placement,Trick-taking                                                                                                 </span></td><td>Blackrock Games,Games 4 Gamers,HOT Games,Lautapelit.fi,Lucrum Games,playagame edizioni,Renegade Game Studios</td><td>7.20114</td><td> 790</td></tr>\n",

After three levels (3 rounds of monsters in each level) they face the Dungeon Lord and the Dragon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has two heroes, one for your right and one for your left hand. Players simultaneously reveal 2 dungeon cards each and quickly put their hands on the cards they want their heroes to fight. If you win you claim the card as loot and/or equipment that increases the abilities of your hero. Equipment cards are placed partly under your hero card, with the ability symbol sticking out. This way the 4 different types of abilities (Melee, Ranged, Magic and Stealth) are built up in one direction each, out from your hero.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For particularly strong monsters your heroes can combine their power, by hitting the monster with both your hands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3149078.jpg</td><td>5</td><td> 19</td><td> 8</td><td>2</td><td>13</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Dungeon Rush                                                              </span></td><td> 19</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Lauri Bremer,Tuuli Hypén,Jere Kasanen                    </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Card Game,Fantasy,Fighting,Humor,Real-time                    </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Rustan Håkansson,Eli Håkansson                                         </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                     </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Variable Player Powers                                                                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Lautapelit.fi,Lucrum Games,playagame edizioni,Stronghold Games                                              </span></td><td>6.59226</td><td> 133</td></tr>\n",

As a mansion owner, you've come to the Freak Shop to stock your mansion with the horrors that will guarantee that your visitors have a most unforgettable stay!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Freak Shop is a short and simple tactical card game for 2 to 5 players that relies on a tricky trade mechanism. All cards in the game represent the frightening things, with values going from 1 to 10, that any real good freaky mansion owner must have in their collection. Players begin with four cards in their mansion (personal area), and cards are available in the Freak Shop (common zone at the center of the table). Each player's aim is to have their mansion worth the most fear points when the Freak Shop closes, with points coming from a combination of three randomly chosen objectives. To achieve this, they try to make the best trades between cards currently in their mansion and cards available in the Shop so that their collection grows in both quantity and value, while also best fitting the objectives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn, you make one single trade between cards currently in your mansion and cards available in the Shop. To do that, you have the choice between two options:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Sell at the fair price =&amp;gt; Trade any number of cards totaling a given value for any number of cards worth exactly the same total value. &amp;#10;     Get a good deal =&amp;gt;  Exchange a series of cards of one single value with a series of the same number of cards of another single value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Throughout a game of Freak Shop, you try to take the best trade opportunities each turn to first make your mansion grow, then ensure that you can end with the collection worth the most points. Good deals help to get higher value cards, and fair price trades help to get more cards in your mansion. As everything is about trades, a central strategic point is to determine which cards are better used for optimizing new trades instead of being kept for scoring!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3152633.jpg</td><td>5</td><td> 30</td><td> 8</td><td>2</td><td>15</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Freak Shop                                                                </span></td><td> 30</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Miguel Coimbra                                           </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Card Game                                                     </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Henri Kermarrec                                                        </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Freak Shop: Card \"13\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                     </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Set Collection,Trading                                                                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Catch Up Games                                                                                              </span></td><td>6.70659</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  82</span></td></tr>\n",

Railroad Revolution drops you straight into the middle of these tempestuous years; a time that changed America forever.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Railroad Revolution, you will manage your own railroad company, ruthlessly competing to be the most powerful railroad tycoon across all America. You will build railroads, establish stations in your connected cities, expand the network of telegraph lines, and chase your objectives, increasing the value of your company with every action you take.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You start with mainly a team of non-specialized workers, but during the game you can hire additional ones with specific skill sets. The cost or effect of an action is determined by the type of worker that does it. To complete your company objectives, you will have to remove some of your workers from your active pool, promoting them to managerial positions. You must carefully assign each of your workers to perform the right action at the right time in order to exploit their specializations in the best way. You need to decide which ones to promote and which are instead still needed to take actions, as your priorities will change from turn to turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Railroad Revolution is a fast paced game with relatively simple rules, and it provides you with interesting and challenging decisions. Having a good strategy and finding the correct timing to implement it, is the key to winning the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3200781.jpg</td><td>4</td><td> 90</td><td>12</td><td>2</td><td>45</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Railroad Revolution                                                       </span></td><td> 90</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Mariano Iannelli                                         </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Trains                                                        </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Marco Canetta,Stefania Niccolini                                       </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                     </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Route/Network Building                                                                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>hobbity.eu,Pegasus Spiele,Red Glove,What's Your Game?                                                       </span></td><td>7.58073</td><td>1023</td></tr>\n",

While the fox character is alone, the hunter has a team of hounds to help him hunt the fox.

For the fox to win, it has to run out the clock, which is done by either finding the three timepiece tiles or flipping over 43 of the 49 tiles.

Morpheus must make sure that dreams leave Oniria to the world and minds of mortals at the same rate as to this moment, otherwise Earth is doomed to regress of thinking and Oniria &amp;ndash; to annihilation. Mortals need dreams to think, remember and stimulate their imagination, Oniria needs sleeping humans to exist &amp;ndash; without dreamers Oniria will be left without power. But Morpheus cannot rule Kingdom of Dreams and create dreams and send them alone. That is why he needs an assistant.  He makes a competition &amp;ndash; Dreamweavers have three months (this is rather foggy, time in Oniria works &amp;ndash; like most things &amp;ndash; differently than in mortal world) to weave the most dreams with the most powerful oniric energies &amp;ndash; the best weaver will become Morpheus&amp;rsquo; right hand, and simultaneously second most powerful creature in Oniria.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Morpheus is a game for 2-4 players in which players will create dreams. At the beginning of each turn, the active player rolls the dice. Then, players will choose the dice and according to the number they will get different gifts, with essence among them. After that, at certain locations Dreamweavers can assign the essence to dreams and completing them. Other gifts include Chronite, a rare mineral able to bend time, used as a currency and Onirite, a device which can bend the structure of Oniria, allowing players to take additional actions. Dreamweavers will travel through the land of Oniria exactly three months of game-time, which equals 21 turns. The board is randomly assembled from tiles and dreamweavers will go a full circle from location to location. Player who creates the most powerful dreams and collects the most victory points wins the game and becomes right hand and assistant of Morpheus.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3175339.jpg</td><td>4</td><td> 60</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>30</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Morpheus                                                                  </span></td><td> 60</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Krzysztof Matusik                                        </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Dice,Fantasy,Mythology                                        </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Krzysztof Matusik                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                     </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Dice Rolling,Modular Board,Set Collection,Variable Phase Order                                                                              </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Tailor Games                                                                                                </span></td><td>6.81482</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  54</span></td></tr>\n",

Each player sees the clues &amp;mdash; person + location + weapon &amp;mdash; for the other players but not their own. They investigate by asking questions, by consulting the secret informant, and by making accusations in order to collect clues and rule out suspects. The goal of the game is to identify which of the 13 clues match their case before the others do!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3175792.png</td><td>6</td><td> 30</td><td> 8</td><td>2</td><td>30</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>13 Clues                                                                  </span></td><td> 30</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Giacomo Tappainer                                        </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Deduction                                                     </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Andrés J.

On your turn, you have the opportunity to both play and prepare a card. You can also spend cards to draft more troops, or use cards to attrition your opponents. However, your deck represents your overall resources, so moving too quickly through your deck early might result in your unsupported armies being swept away in the final rounds of the game. This is worth it if you can capture Berlin or Paris in 1915, but if your gambit fails, you may have a tough road ahead.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends after 17 rounds of play, or earlier if one side has a commanding lead.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3183517.jpg</td><td>5</td><td>120</td><td>12</td><td>2</td><td>90</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Quartermaster General: 1914                                               </span></td><td>120</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Nicholas Avallone                                        </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Wargame,World War I                                           </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Ian Brody                                                              </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Quartermaster Series                                                                   </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Area Control / Area Influence,Campaign / Battle Card Driven,Card Drafting,Co-operative Play,Deck / Pool Building,Hand Management            </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>PSC Games                                                                                                   </span></td><td>7.93394</td><td> 193</td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>208775</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>This is a new edition of the Spiel des Jahres-nominated dice game.  In this version everything is bigger, the players have boards with dry erase markers in place of the original paper and pencil.  This edition is also for up to 8 players instead of only 5 in the original game.  The biggest change in this edition, though, is that on the back of the regular player boards are the Qwixx Mixx boards which have the colors scrambled throughout the different lines, which changes many of the strategies while keeping the mechanisms largely the same.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules for Qwixx:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Qwixx is a quick-playing dice game in which everyone participates, no matter whose turn it is. Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, the active player rolls six dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows, then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that's the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you mark off the 2 or 12 in a row and have at least five numbers marked in that row, you get to also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box. Whoever has the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3264158.jpg</td><td>8</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  0</span></td><td> 8</td><td>2</td><td>20</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Qwixx Deluxe                                                              </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  0</span></td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                       </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Dice                                                          </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Steffen Benndorf                                                       </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                     </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Dice Rolling                                                                                                                                </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Gamewright                                                                                                  </span></td><td>7.24785</td><td> 149</td></tr>\n",

Set in the world of Runeterra, players take on the roles of four intrepid Yordles: Corki, Tristana, Heimerdinger, and Ziggs, who must join forces and pilot their newly-crafted mechs against an army of marauding minions. With modular boards, programmatic command lines, and a story-driven campaign, each mission will be unique, putting your teamwork, programming, and piloting skills to the test.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are ten missions in total, and each individual mission will take about 60-90 minutes. The box includes five game boards, four command lines (one for each player), four painted mech miniatures, ability and damage decks, a sand timer, a bomb-like-power source miniature, 6 metal trackers, 4 acrylic shards, 4 dice, and 100 minion miniatures.  There also appears to be some large object trying to get out of that sealed box...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3184103.jpg</td><td>4</td><td> 90</td><td>14</td><td>2</td><td>60</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Mechs vs. Minions                                                         </span></td><td> 90</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Danny Beck,Tysen Henderson                               </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Fantasy,Fighting,Miniatures,Video Game Theme                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td>Chris Cantrell,Rick Ernst,Stone Librande,Prashant Saraswat,Nathan Tiras</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Campaign Games,Components: Miniatures                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Action / Movement Programming,Card Drafting,Co-operative Play,Dice Rolling,Modular Board,Variable Player Powers                             </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Riot Games                                                                                                  </span></td><td>8.37548</td><td>4602</td></tr>\n",

Building huts, bringing offerings to the druid, gathering precious runestones, and building monumental temples is the only way to earn the favor of the gods in Meduris.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Skillful use of the workers lets you obtain valuable materials. These are needed to build huts and temples.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. The larger the settlement,the more expensive it is to build a hut there. But if you can get in the good graces of the druid by presenting an offering, then your effort pays off.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. Keep an eye on the other players: Who will secure the best building sites at the right time, and collect the most valuable rune stones?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4.

Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.'&amp;quot;'&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dominion is not a collectible card game (CCG), but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 26 Kingdom card types to include in any given play&amp;mdash;leading to immense variety.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dominion (Second Edition) replaces six Kingdom card types from the first edition with six new types of Kingdom cards, while also replacing the blank cards in the game with a seventh new Kingdom card. These new cards are available on their own in the Dominion: Update Pack. The rulebook has been rewritten, three cards have mild functional changes (&amp;quot;you may&amp;quot; added to Moneylender, Mine, Throne Room), and other cards have been rephrased (while remaining functionally the same).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dominion: Update Pack contains the seven new kingdom cards introduced in the second edition of Dominion, thereby allowing owners of the first edition to obtain these new cards without needing to repurchase the entire game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3187001.jpg</td><td>4</td><td> 30</td><td>14</td><td>2</td><td>30</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Dominion (Second Edition)                                                 </span></td><td> 30</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Julien Delval                                            </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Card Game,Medieval                                            </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Dominion: Update Pack,Dominion (Second Edition) Big Box                                                                                             </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Donald X.

Players take turns adding strength to the battlefield until both players pass. The highest strength on the battlefield wins the round and matches are played best of three, with little to no card drawing in between rounds. Special cards may also be played to reduce the effect of certain unit types. Gwent also features various once-per-game leader abilities and deck building rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3194375.jpg</td><td>2</td><td> 30</td><td> 0</td><td>2</td><td> 5</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Gwent: Nilfgaard and Northern Realms                                      </span></td><td> 30</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>CD Projekt                                               </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Card Game,Collectible Components,Video Game Theme             </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>CD Projekt                                                             </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                     </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Hand Management                                                                                                                             </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>CD Projekt RED                                                                                              </span></td><td>7.10388</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  85</span></td></tr>\n",

You acquire smaller corporations in global stock markets, borrow from debt markets to finance your investments, use superpowers like a pawn to invade third world countries and take their oil, lobby the governments to grant you more subsidies and compete with other mega-corporations for leadership in market share.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Uncontrollably, the world is not in its most stable state either. Chances of a global economic crisis or geopolitical power shifts may ruin your investments.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is set in a complex and dynamic global economy, where profitable industries, interest rates, global growth and geopolitical landscape change constantly and the scepter of an economic crisis always present. Players must analyze and influence these new trends. The world's superpowers may compete for world dominance but you care little about the grand chessboard, except when your profits are concerned!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3276023.jpg</td><td>4</td><td>180</td><td>16</td><td>2</td><td>80</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Incorporated                                                              </span></td><td>180</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Cem Akkartal,Sebastian Koziner                           </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Economic,Political,Wargame                                    </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Can Adatepe                                                            </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                     </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Area Control / Area Influence,Auction/Bidding,Stock Holding,Worker Placement                                                                </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>(Self-Published),TCA Games                                                                                  </span></td><td>7.60694</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  72</span></td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>210342</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Timeline: British History is a card game played using 109 cards. Each card depicts an event on both sides, with the year in which that it occured on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Timeline: British History can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3225966.jpg</td><td>8</td><td> 30</td><td> 8</td><td>2</td><td>15</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Timeline: British History                                                 </span></td><td> 30</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Xavier Collette,Nicolas Fructus                          </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Card Game                                                     </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Frédéric Henry                                                         </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Timeline                                                                               </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                          </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Asmodee                                                                                                     </span></td><td>6.72545</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  55</span></td></tr>\n",

The players take turns being robbers and exhibitors at a board game trade fair &amp;mdash; rolling dice, lying, guessing, and shuffling cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The exhibitor tries to hide cash in one of the cash boxes and keep it hidden - shell game style. The robber secretly rolls a pair of dice and then tries to make increasingly risky moves to gain more information about the location of the cash and move the clerk away from the full cash box. If the exhibitor catches the thief in a lie, the thief must immediately risk stealing from a cash box without additional information.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3217446.jpg</td><td>2</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  5</span></td><td>14</td><td>2</td><td> 5</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Steal This Game                                                           </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  5</span></td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Viktor Csete,Mihajlo Dimitrievski,Katalin Nimmerfroh     </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Bluffing,Deduction,Dice                                       </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Dávid Turczi                                                           </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                     </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Dice Rolling,Memory                                                                                                                         </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>LudiCreations                                                                                               </span></td><td>6.92760</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  50</span></td></tr>\n",

       "\t<tr><td>212445</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Blood Bowl is a game of Fantasy Football. The basic game features a match between two teams drawn from a number of fantasy archetypes, playing a warped version of American Football.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Blood Bowl boxed game contains two teams: Humans, an all-round team who are flexible enough to adapt to any style of play, or Orcs, who make up in brute force what they lack in finesse. The teams are represented by coloured plastic miniatures, and push-fit assembly is required before use. The game is expandable, and additional rules and teams will be made available through expansion sets and supplements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Actions in the game are resolved through the use of dice. Regular six-sided dice are used to make tests in a number of cases, such as when a player attempts to pick up the ball, pass it, catch it or dodge past an enemy player. Custom dice are used when one player wishes to Block another, using graphics to represent each of the different (but all violent) potential outcomes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules in this edition of Blood Bowl are almost identical to those found in the Competition Rules Pack, which was the culmination of several years of development of the Blood Bowl Living Rulebook. This has resulted in an incredibly well-honed game which sees regular competition play around the world. In fact each team takes turns moving, blocking and advancing the football down the field. The game comes with plastic miniatures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is a part of the Blood Bowl Series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3254491.jpg</td><td>2</td><td>120</td><td>12</td><td>2</td><td>45</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Blood Bowl (2016 edition)                                                 </span></td><td>120</td><td>...</td><td>Wayne England,David Gallagher,Pete Knifton,Richard Wright</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Fantasy,Fighting,Miniatures,Sports                            </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Jervis Johnson                                                         </span></td><td>Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Blitzmania Special Play Promo Cards,Blood Bowl (2016 Edition): Blood on the Snow,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Bright Crusaders,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Death Roller,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Death Zone – Season One,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Dwarf Giants,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Go Full Beard Special Play Promo Card,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Goblin &amp; Halfling Referee Rules,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Grak and Crumbleberry Star Players,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Griff Oberwald,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Grim Ironjaw,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Grombrindal and the Black Gobbo,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Hall of Fame Card Pack,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Morg 'N' Thorg,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Ogre,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Rat Ogre,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Reikland Reavers,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Skaven &amp; Dwarf Pitch,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Special Ball Rules,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Team Titans Special Play Card Pack,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): The Early Bird Special Play Promo Card,Blood Bowl (2016 Edition): The Gouged Eye,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): The Mighty Zug,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): The Skavenblight Scramblers,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Troll,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Varag Ghoul-Chewer,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Winter Bowl Inducements</td><td>Blood Bowl,Fantasy Sports,Games Workshop Specialist Games,Warhammer Fantasy Board Games</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Dice Rolling,Grid Movement,Variable Player Powers                                                                                           </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Games Workshop Ltd.                                                                                         </span></td><td>8.39254</td><td> 632</td></tr>\n",

NVA expertise in lure and ambush tactics resulted in significant US casualties. US mobility and the ability to bring massive amounts of firepower to bear quickly virtually destroyed the attacking NVA division and forced a change in NVA tactics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This re-issue of GMT Games' 1990 CSR Award winning title that started it all keeps the original operational system, but streamlines to it to include innovative combat resolution integrating maneuver combat, close assault, artillery bombardment, and support from gunships and air sorties.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Increased accessibility to primary and secondary source material has made it possible to make changes to more accurately represent both sides' unique capabilities without significantly altering or breaking the base game system.

Players each control three different heroes and have access to a tech tree that allows them to use different strategies each time they play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of the game is to destroy the opponent's base. To do this, players build up an army of units and heroes. Players determine the exact composition of their armies as they play by adding cards to their deck based on the tech they've chosen to pursue.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;

Let's see whether you can put together good shots...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Wind the Film!, you're trying to organize pictures on your roll so that they appear in the right order. Each player has a hand of cards, and on a turn, you'll add 1-3 cards to the front of your hand (without changing their order), move one card in your hand closer to the front, then discard as many cards from the back of your hand as the number of cards that you added. When the sunset card comes out, you can take no more pictures, and everyone scores for what's on their camera.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cards all have numbers and colors on them, and you try to line them up in hand to score the most points possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </span></td><td>//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3290975.png</td><td>4</td><td> 20</td><td>12</td><td>2</td><td>20</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Wind the Film!                                                            </span></td><td> 20</td><td>...</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>&lt;U+5B9D&gt;&lt;U+4E95&gt; &lt;U+8CB4&gt;&lt;U+5B50&gt; (Takako Takarai)       </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Card Game                                                     </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Saashi                                                                 </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                                     </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Hand Management,Set Collection                                                                                                              </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Saashi &amp; Saashi                                                                                             </span></td><td>7.28016</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  63</span></td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>216201</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>The race is on for the robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory who work long, hard days at the assembly line building high&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#144;speed supercars, but never get to see them in action. On Saturday nights, the factory comes to life as the ultimate race course with treacherous obstacles and rival sabotage. In Robo Rally, players move their robots through the course by speeding through corridors and dodging traps to reach each checkpoint first. Only the strongest robots survive!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Enter the world of mad machines and dangerous schemes in the Robo Rally board game. Players control their robot with game cards which reveal directions on how the robots can move through the hectic Robo Rally automobile factory. Use strategy to outsmart rival robots while racing towards each checkpoint in your chosen course in numerical order. Beware of factory obstacles such as industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts that can make or break the race.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2016 edition of Robo Rally differs from earlier versions in a number of ways:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Players each now have their own deck of twenty cards, with the same cards in each deck. On a turn, a player draws nine cards from their deck, programs five of the cards, then discards the rest. Two cards says &amp;quot;Again&amp;quot; and repeat the action programmed in the previous slot; one card says &amp;quot;Energy&amp;quot; and gives a energy cube which you can use to buy options.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Since each player has their own deck, the cards no longer have priority numbers to determine who moves first. Now movement order is determined by whoever is closest to a transmitter on the game board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Players start with a hand of three option cards and five energy. Each option card has an energy cost, and you can purchase additional option cards for the cost of two energy each. Players can earn energy by programming it, by being the first to a pitstop, or by starting their turn on a pitstop.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    When players are damaged, they no longer receive one less card for each damage (or have one of their program registers locked) at the start of a round; instead they receive damage cards that will be shuffled into their decks. &amp;quot;Normal&amp;quot; damage from the board or a robot laser gives you &amp;quot;spam&amp;quot; damage. When you program one of these cards, you remove it from play at the appropriate time and replace it in the register with the top card from your deck. Surprise! Other types of damage exist, with a Trojan horse granting you two spam, a virus infecting nearby players, and a worm forcing you to reboot, which gives you even more damage.

       "\t  1 & Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The 1986 edition featured 4 parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to 5 players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to 5 players and adds a shorter 5 round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Die Macher is \\#1 in the Valley Games Classic

       "\t  2 & Dragonmaster is a trick-taking card game based on an older game called Coup d'etat. Each player is given a supply of plastic gems, which represent points. Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if \\&quot;first\\&quot; or \\&quot;last\\&quot; is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands. At the end, the biggest pile of gems wins the game.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Jewel contents:\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;11 clear (3 extra)\\&\\#10;13 green (1 extra)\\&\\#10;22 red (2 extra)\\&\\#10;22 blue (2 extra)\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic184174.jpg  &  4 &  30 & 12 & 3 &  30 & Dragonmaster                &  30 & ... & Bob Pepper                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            & Card Game,Fantasy                                                            & NA                                                                                                              & G.

       "\t  3 & Part of the Knizia tile-laying trilogy, Samurai is set in medieval Japan. Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha tokens scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions \\&mdash; or all three at once! Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each token (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Gameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four tokens have been removed from play due to a tie for influence.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types. Ties are not uncommon and are broken based on the number of other, \\&quot;non-majority\\&quot; symbols each player has collected.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;

       "\t  4 & When you see the triangular box and the luxurious, large blocks, you can tell this game was designed to be beautiful as well as functional.  The object of the game is to build pyramids out of the different colored blocks.  A pyramid scores more points when it's made from a few colors, but it's much harder to consistently outbid the other players for the necessary blocks.  The game is over when the Pharoah's Pyramid in the center is completed, which is built using all the blocks that the players don't use during the course of the game.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Final round 1990

       "\t  5 & In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher.  Some versions of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Note: many books and websites list this as a 1962 publication. This is incorrect; information from Sid Sackson's diaries, correspondence, and royalty statements prove that it was published in 1964.  However, for some reason admins continue to accept \\&quot;corrections\\&quot; of the publication date to 1962.

       "\t  7 & In Cathedral, each player has a set of pieces of a different color. The pieces are in the shapes of buildings, covering from one to five square units. The first player takes the single neutral Cathedral piece and places it onto the board. Players then alternate placing one of their buildings onto the board until neither player can place another building. Players capture territory by surrounding areas that are occupied by at most one opponent or neutral building. A captured piece is removed and captured territory becomes off-limits to the opponent. The player with the fewest 'square units' of buildings that can't be placed wins.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic181642.jpg  &  2 &  20 &  8 & 2 &  20 & Cathedral                   &  20 & ... & S.

       "\t  8 & In this interesting offering from Warfrog, players become Gods seeking to dominate a world with their followers.  The first part of the game involves constructing the game board, after which players take turns using cards to determine how many new people should appear and what type of terrain they will inhabit.  All tribes start off as barbarians, but soon the calming effect of civilization settles the marauding bands; although civilized tribes score more, they can no longer attack.  What they can do, though, is civilize other players' followers.  Sure it gives opponents more points, but at least those followers won't come after you!\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;

       "\t  9 & Although referred to as a sequel to El Grande, El Caballero shares few aspects with its namesake, being a fun but intense brain-burner in which players explore and attempt to control the lands and waterways of the New World.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The players are following Columbus by exploring the islands he discovered. Players slowly explore the islands \\&ndash; by picking and placing land tiles that are most favorable to them \\&ndash; and discover wealth in the form of gold and fish. As they learn about the land and sea areas of this new land, they position their caballeros to try to maintain control of the important regions. Castillos give them a measure of protection from others, and ships allow them to establish trade and to fish for food. Success is measured in the size of land and sea areas they control.

       "\t 10 & Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).\\&\\#10;  \\&\\#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10; & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1798136.jpg &  6 &  60 & 10 & 2 &  60 & Elfenland                   &  60 & ... & Doris Matthäus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & Fantasy,Travel                                                               & NA                                                                                                              & Alan R.

       "\t 11 & Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The cards are colorful depictions of beans in various descriptive poses, and the object is to make coins by planting fields (sets) of these beans and then harvesting them.  To help players match their cards up, the game features extensive trading and deal making.  One of the most unique features of the game is that you cannot rearrange your hand, as you need to play the cards in the order that you draw them.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box.  One difference in the contents, however, is that bean \\#22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean.  This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;

       "\t 12 & Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.  Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns).  Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs.  Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.  The game lasts for three \\&quot;epochs\\&quot; (rounds).  The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;From the Box:\\&\\#10;The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!\\&\\#10;The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people.

       "\t 13 & In Catan (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)\\&mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone\\&mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities\\&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;

       "\t 14 & Basari is a game of gem merchants competing in a marketplace\\&quot;: racing, collecting, trading, and predicting what the other merchants will do.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;To start the game, players receive 12 gemstones (3 each of 4 colors). \\&\\#10;Each turn there will be a movement phase and an action phase:\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;For movement, everyone simultaneously rolls their die and moves their markers around a track.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;They then choose one of three different actions to perform. The actions are:\\&\\#10;- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, \\&\\#10;- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or \\&\\#10;- to roll and move again and also collect points.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;A new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Re-implemented by:\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;     Edel, Stein \\& Reich\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;

       "\t 15 & By request of Fantasy Flight Games, Board Game Geek lists the various editions of Cosmic Encounter in separate entries. Each edition is the same game at its core, but the features, compatible expansions, and production differ among them. This entry is for the original 1977 Eon version.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Players represent alien races that are seeking to spread themselves onto five foreign worlds.  To accomplish this, they make challenges against other players and enlist the aid of interested parties.  But alien powers, which are unique to each race, give players ways to bend or outright break some rule in the game.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The game continues until one player occupies five planets in other systems to win.

       "\t 16 & Taking on the roles of shop owners in the Moroccan marketplace, players buy various shops, as color-coded tourists in the form of neat little wooden people in hats start showing up at the entry gate. Players can then move them into their own like-colored shops to earn money or move them into opponents' shops for a share of the profits. After all the tourists have been placed onto the board, the player with the biggest bankroll takes the victory.

       "\t 17 & This game gained a quick following after one of the major gaming conventions of 1999.  It features several characters, represented on actual stickpin buttons, that each have a unique allowance of polyhedral dice.  These dice endow each  character with fairly unique combat abilities.  Players roll the dice against each other and take their opponents' dice as casualties.  The object of the game is take out the most die 'sides' during the combat.  It's quite simple, quite inventive, and deeper than it would seem at first.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;

       "\t 18 & The robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line. They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's \\&quot;registers\\&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;

       "\t 19 & A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing).  Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr\\&uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair \\&amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call \\&quot;Wacky Water!\\&quot; \\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment \\#5, which states: \\&quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...\\&quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tiles-perhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;

       "\t 20 & In this game of science fiction strip mining, players land on a planet and try and grab as much ore as possible and take off before the game is over.  Each player has tanks, boats, barges, mining equipment and a base ship at his disposal and will have to contend with the weather and the other miners.  The game uses an action point allowance system and thus is dice free.  Each player on his turn has a pool of points that he can divide in a variety of ways, putting all the points into one unit's movement or dividing them among several units.  Each turn is timed so players have to think quickly, and once a move has been made it cannot be retracted.  The game itself is beautifully put together, with a detailed hex grid and real metal miniatures for all of the units.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Online Play: \\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;    Full Metal Galaxy\\&\\#10;

       "\t 22 & From the 2nd edition rulebook intro for MAGIC REALM:\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;MAGIC REALM is a game of fantasy adventuring, set in a land filled with monsters, fabulous treasures, great warriors, and magicians. The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.\\&\\#10;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.\\&\\#10;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic148345.jpg  & 16 & 240 & 12 & 1 & 240 & Magic Realm                 & 240 & ... & George Goebel,Kim Grommel,Richard Hamblen,Randall C.

       "\t 26 & A game that is often described as a semi-sequel to Civilization.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Players attempt to build up their cultures during the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods. The game features a card deck that holds events, payout cards, and famous leaders of the particular eras.

       "\t 30 & An epic fantasy quest to recover an ancient magic scepter from a tyrant king in his Dark Tower, brought to life in electronic form.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;To vanquish the usurper, players search the four realms of the circular game board for three keys to unlock the tower's gate.  On this journey, there are battles to be fought against roving bands of brigands, dragons, plague and hunger.  There are bazaars to visit to purchase supplies and assistants for the quest.  There are uncharted territories to get lost in and tombs and ruins to plunder.  And there is a mighty army to be raised before the player can lay seige to the tower and fight either to glorious victory or crushing defeat.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Dated and primitive by today's standards, Dark Tower was nevertheless an astonishing achievement when it was released in 1981.  Every aspect of the game was monitored by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself, an unheard of innovation at the time.  Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors.

       "\t 31 & Along the lines of HeroQuest comes a much more heavily produced game called Dark World. One player is the evil lord who controls the dungeon in which the rest of the players move their characters from room to room, fighting monsters and gaining treasure. Real working treasure chests with magic weapons inside and the figures even get to put their new weapons in their character's hands.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;

Each player must expand their personal maps to maximize their scoring possibilities.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Manipulating your position in the player order is crucial for mastering Honshu.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3311364.jpg & 5 &  40 &  8 & 2 & 30 & Honshu                                                                     &  40 & ... & Ossi Hiekkala,Jere Kasanen                                & Card Game,City Building                                        & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Kalle Malmioja                                                          & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & Asian Theme,Country: Japan                                                              & Hand Management,Tile Placement,Trick-taking                                                                                                  & Blackrock Games,Games 4 Gamers,HOT Games,Lautapelit.fi,Lucrum Games,playagame edizioni,Renegade Game Studios & 7.20114 &  790\\\\\n",
       "\t 207338 & In Dungeon Rush, players are adventurers rushing through a perilous dungeon to root out evil, earning coins and improving their abilities along the way. After three levels (3 rounds of monsters in each level) they face the Dungeon Lord and the Dragon.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Each player has two heroes, one for your right and one for your left hand. Players simultaneously reveal 2 dungeon cards each and quickly put their hands on the cards they want their heroes to fight. If you win you claim the card as loot and/or equipment that increases the abilities of your hero. Equipment cards are placed partly under your hero card, with the ability symbol sticking out. This way the 4 different types of abilities (Melee, Ranged, Magic and Stealth) are built up in one direction each, out from your hero.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;For particularly strong monsters your heroes can combine their power, by hitting the monster with both your hands.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3149078.jpg & 5 &  19 &  8 & 2 & 13 & Dungeon Rush                                                               &  19 & ... & Lauri Bremer,Tuuli Hypén,Jere Kasanen                     & Card Game,Fantasy,Fighting,Humor,Real-time                     & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Rustan Håkansson,Eli Håkansson                                          & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & NA                                                                                      & Variable Player Powers                                                                                                                       & Lautapelit.fi,Lucrum Games,playagame edizioni,Stronghold Games                                               & 6.59226 &  133\\\\\n",
       "\t 207487 & Game description from the publisher:\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The tourist season is fast approaching. As a mansion owner, you've come to the Freak Shop to stock your mansion with the horrors that will guarantee that your visitors have a most unforgettable stay!\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Freak Shop is a short and simple tactical card game for 2 to 5 players that relies on a tricky trade mechanism. All cards in the game represent the frightening things, with values going from 1 to 10, that any real good freaky mansion owner must have in their collection. Players begin with four cards in their mansion (personal area), and cards are available in the Freak Shop (common zone at the center of the table). Each player's aim is to have their mansion worth the most fear points when the Freak Shop closes, with points coming from a combination of three randomly chosen objectives. To achieve this, they try to make the best trades between cards currently in their mansion and cards available in the Shop so that their collection grows in both quantity and value, while also best fitting the objectives.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;On your turn, you make one single trade between cards currently in your mansion and cards available in the Shop. To do that, you have the choice between two options:\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;     Sell at the fair price =\\&gt; Trade any number of cards totaling a given value for any number of cards worth exactly the same total value. \\&\\#10;     Get a good deal =\\&gt;  Exchange a series of cards of one single value with a series of the same number of cards of another single value.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Throughout a game of Freak Shop, you try to take the best trade opportunities each turn to first make your mansion grow, then ensure that you can end with the collection worth the most points. Good deals help to get higher value cards, and fair price trades help to get more cards in your mansion. As everything is about trades, a central strategic point is to determine which cards are better used for optimizing new trades instead of being kept for scoring!\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3152633.jpg & 5 &  30 &  8 & 2 & 15 & Freak Shop                                                                 &  30 & ... & Miguel Coimbra                                            & Card Game                                                      & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Henri Kermarrec                                                         & Freak Shop: Card \"13\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    & NA                                                                                      & Set Collection,Trading                                                                                                                       & Catch Up Games                                                                                               & 6.70659 &   82\\\\\n",
       "\t 207691 & Ambition and a thirst for wealth have driven humanity to strive for ever greater progress. In America, during the 19th century, battles were waged between huge railway corporations that sought to connect state to state and coast with coast\\&hellip; making themselves filthy rich in the process. Railroad Revolution drops you straight into the middle of these tempestuous years; a time that changed America forever.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;In Railroad Revolution, you will manage your own railroad company, ruthlessly competing to be the most powerful railroad tycoon across all America. You will build railroads, establish stations in your connected cities, expand the network of telegraph lines, and chase your objectives, increasing the value of your company with every action you take.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;You start with mainly a team of non-specialized workers, but during the game you can hire additional ones with specific skill sets. The cost or effect of an action is determined by the type of worker that does it. To complete your company objectives, you will have to remove some of your workers from your active pool, promoting them to managerial positions. You must carefully assign each of your workers to perform the right action at the right time in order to exploit their specializations in the best way. You need to decide which ones to promote and which are instead still needed to take actions, as your priorities will change from turn to turn.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Railroad Revolution is a fast paced game with relatively simple rules, and it provides you with interesting and challenging decisions. Having a good strategy and finding the correct timing to implement it, is the key to winning the game.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3200781.jpg & 4 &  90 & 12 & 2 & 45 & Railroad Revolution                                                        &  90 & ... & Mariano Iannelli                                          & Trains                                                         & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Marco Canetta,Stefania Niccolini                                        & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & NA                                                                                      & Route/Network Building                                                                                                                       & hobbity.eu,Pegasus Spiele,Red Glove,What's Your Game?                                                        & 7.58073 & 1023\\\\\n",

While the fox character is alone, the hunter has a team of hounds to help him hunt the fox. All the hunter has to do to win is either corner the fox with his dogs or force the fox to end his turn next to the hunter himself. For the fox to win, it has to run out the clock, which is done by either finding the three timepiece tiles or flipping over 43 of the 49 tiles.

       "\t 208217 & After many millennia, Hypnos is leaving the throne. Now it belongs to the Morpheus, Hypnos' right hand and son. Morpheus must make sure that dreams leave Oniria to the world and minds of mortals at the same rate as to this moment, otherwise Earth is doomed to regress of thinking and Oniria \\&ndash; to annihilation. Mortals need dreams to think, remember and stimulate their imagination, Oniria needs sleeping humans to exist \\&ndash; without dreamers Oniria will be left without power. But Morpheus cannot rule Kingdom of Dreams and create dreams and send them alone. That is why he needs an assistant.  He makes a competition \\&ndash; Dreamweavers have three months (this is rather foggy, time in Oniria works \\&ndash; like most things \\&ndash; differently than in mortal world) to weave the most dreams with the most powerful oniric energies \\&ndash; the best weaver will become Morpheus\\&rsquo; right hand, and simultaneously second most powerful creature in Oniria.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Morpheus is a game for 2-4 players in which players will create dreams. At the beginning of each turn, the active player rolls the dice. Then, players will choose the dice and according to the number they will get different gifts, with essence among them. After that, at certain locations Dreamweavers can assign the essence to dreams and completing them. Other gifts include Chronite, a rare mineral able to bend time, used as a currency and Onirite, a device which can bend the structure of Oniria, allowing players to take additional actions. Dreamweavers will travel through the land of Oniria exactly three months of game-time, which equals 21 turns. The board is randomly assembled from tiles and dreamweavers will go a full circle from location to location.

Each player sees the clues \\&mdash; person + location + weapon \\&mdash; for the other players but not their own. They investigate by asking questions, by consulting the secret informant, and by making accusations in order to collect clues and rule out suspects. The goal of the game is to identify which of the 13 clues match their case before the others do!\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3175792.png & 6 &  30 &  8 & 2 & 30 & 13 Clues                                                                   &  30 & ... & Giacomo Tappainer                                         & Deduction                                                      & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Andrés J.

       "\t 208773 & Game description from the publisher:\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Quartermaster General: 1914 is the next title in the critically acclaimed Quartermaster General series by Ian Brody and creates a narrative of the First World War in Europe, reflecting the military, technological, and social changes that occurred over the following four years.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;In Quartermaster General: 1914, each card has two different uses: one when played, and another when prepared. On your turn, you have the opportunity to both play and prepare a card. You can also spend cards to draft more troops, or use cards to attrition your opponents. However, your deck represents your overall resources, so moving too quickly through your deck early might result in your unsupported armies being swept away in the final rounds of the game. This is worth it if you can capture Berlin or Paris in 1915, but if your gambit fails, you may have a tough road ahead.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The game ends after 17 rounds of play, or earlier if one side has a commanding lead.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3183517.jpg & 5 & 120 & 12 & 2 & 90 & Quartermaster General: 1914                                                & 120 & ... & Nicholas Avallone                                         & Wargame,World War I                                            & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Ian Brody                                                               & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & Quartermaster Series                                                                    & Area Control / Area Influence,Campaign / Battle Card Driven,Card Drafting,Co-operative Play,Deck / Pool Building,Hand Management             & PSC Games                                                                                                    & 7.93394 &  193\\\\\n",
       "\t 208775 & This is a new edition of the Spiel des Jahres-nominated dice game.  In this version everything is bigger, the players have boards with dry erase markers in place of the original paper and pencil.  This edition is also for up to 8 players instead of only 5 in the original game.  The biggest change in this edition, though, is that on the back of the regular player boards are the Qwixx Mixx boards which have the colors scrambled throughout the different lines, which changes many of the strategies while keeping the mechanisms largely the same.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The rules for Qwixx:\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Qwixx is a quick-playing dice game in which everyone participates, no matter whose turn it is. Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;On a turn, the active player rolls six dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows, then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that's the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you mark off the 2 or 12 in a row and have at least five numbers marked in that row, you get to also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box. Whoever has the highest score wins.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3264158.jpg & 8 &   0 &  8 & 2 & 20 & Qwixx Deluxe                                                               &   0 & ... & NA                                                        & Dice                                                           & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Steffen Benndorf                                                        & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & NA                                                                                      & Dice Rolling                                                                                                                                 & Gamewright                                                                                                   & 7.24785 &  149\\\\\n",
       "\t 209010 & Mechs vs. Minions is a cooperative tabletop campaign for 2-4 players. Set in the world of Runeterra, players take on the roles of four intrepid Yordles: Corki, Tristana, Heimerdinger, and Ziggs, who must join forces and pilot their newly-crafted mechs against an army of marauding minions. With modular boards, programmatic command lines, and a story-driven campaign, each mission will be unique, putting your teamwork, programming, and piloting skills to the test.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;There are ten missions in total, and each individual mission will take about 60-90 minutes. The box includes five game boards, four command lines (one for each player), four painted mech miniatures, ability and damage decks, a sand timer, a bomb-like-power source miniature, 6 metal trackers, 4 acrylic shards, 4 dice, and 100 minion miniatures.  There also appears to be some large object trying to get out of that sealed box...\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3184103.jpg & 4 &  90 & 14 & 2 & 60 & Mechs vs. Minions                                                          &  90 & ... & Danny Beck,Tysen Henderson                                & Fantasy,Fighting,Miniatures,Video Game Theme                   & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Chris Cantrell,Rick Ernst,Stone Librande,Prashant Saraswat,Nathan Tiras & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & Campaign Games,Components: Miniatures                                                   & Action / Movement Programming,Card Drafting,Co-operative Play,Dice Rolling,Modular Board,Variable Player Powers                              & Riot Games                                                                                                   & 8.37548 & 4602\\\\\n",

Building huts, bringing offerings to the druid, gathering precious runestones, and building monumental temples is the only way to earn the favor of the gods in Meduris.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;1. Skillful use of the workers lets you obtain valuable materials. These are needed to build huts and temples.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;2.

Keep an eye on the other players: Who will secure the best building sites at the right time, and collect the most valuable rune stones?\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;4.

This is why, before adquiring big treasures, you may want to hire some though guys to help you protect it...\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;There are four types of cards in The Treasure of Isla Tortuga:\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;     Decks to expand your ship, so you can fit more cards in it.\\&\\#10;     Objects that give you extra resources or abilities.\\&\\#10;     Treasures, that give you victory points.\\&\\#10;     Crew, that either gives you victory points or help you in boardings. \\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3195620.jpg & 5 &  20 &  8 & 3 & 15 & The Treasure of Isla Tortuga                                               &  20 & ... & Juan M.

All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&quot;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.'\\&quot;'\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can \\&quot;buy\\&quot; as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Dominion is not a collectible card game (CCG), but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 26 Kingdom card types to include in any given play\\&mdash;leading to immense variety.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Dominion (Second Edition) replaces six Kingdom card types from the first edition with six new types of Kingdom cards, while also replacing the blank cards in the game with a seventh new Kingdom card. These new cards are available on their own in the Dominion: Update Pack. The rulebook has been rewritten, three cards have mild functional changes (\\&quot;you may\\&quot; added to Moneylender, Mine, Throne Room), and other cards have been rephrased (while remaining functionally the same).\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Dominion: Update Pack contains the seven new kingdom cards introduced in the second edition of Dominion, thereby allowing owners of the first edition to obtain these new cards without needing to repurchase the entire game.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3187001.jpg & 4 &  30 & 14 & 2 & 30 & Dominion (Second Edition)                                                  &  30 & ... & Julien Delval                                             & Card Game,Medieval                                             & Dominion: Update Pack,Dominion (Second Edition) Big Box                                                                                              & Donald X.

       "\t 209530 & Gwent is a standalone card game included inside the Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt videogame by CD Projekt Red. It was available as a physical copy with the Xbox One Collector's Edition of the video game (Northern Realms and Nilfgaardian Empire factions), in \\&quot;Hearts of Stone\\&quot;physical expansion for PC/PS4 (Scoia'Tel and Monsters factions) and with the purchase of the Season Pass giving you the opportunity to ask for redeem code to buy both limited editions versions on CD Projekt Red merchandising store.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Gwent has two players simulating a war between two of four factions: Northern Realms, Scoia'Tael, Monsters, or Nilfgaardian Empire. Players take turns adding strength to the battlefield until both players pass. The highest strength on the battlefield wins the round and matches are played best of three, with little to no card drawing in between rounds. Special cards may also be played to reduce the effect of certain unit types.

       "\t 210101 & Incorporated is a strategy game of economic warfare, a simulation of modern-day markets, economics and politics.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Incorporated places you as the CEO of a multi-national corporation whose aim is to profit no matter the cost. You acquire smaller corporations in global stock markets, borrow from debt markets to finance your investments, use superpowers like a pawn to invade third world countries and take their oil, lobby the governments to grant you more subsidies and compete with other mega-corporations for leadership in market share.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Uncontrollably, the world is not in its most stable state either. Chances of a global economic crisis or geopolitical power shifts may ruin your investments.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The game is set in a complex and dynamic global economy, where profitable industries, interest rates, global growth and geopolitical landscape change constantly and the scepter of an economic crisis always present. Players must analyze and influence these new trends. The world's superpowers may compete for world dominance but you care little about the grand chessboard, except when your profits are concerned!\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3276023.jpg & 4 & 180 & 16 & 2 & 80 & Incorporated                                                               & 180 & ... & Cem Akkartal,Sebastian Koziner                            & Economic,Political,Wargame                                     & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Can Adatepe                                                             & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & NA                                                                                      & Area Control / Area Influence,Auction/Bidding,Stock Holding,Worker Placement                                                                 & (Self-Published),TCA Games                                                                                   & 7.60694 &   72\\\\\n",
       "\t 210342 & Timeline: British History is a card game played using 109 cards. Each card depicts an event on both sides, with the year in which that it occured on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Timeline: British History can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3225966.jpg & 8 &  30 &  8 & 2 & 15 & Timeline: British History                                                  &  30 & ... & Xavier Collette,Nicolas Fructus                           & Card Game                                                      & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Frédéric Henry                                                          & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & Timeline                                                                                & NA                                                                                                                                           & Asmodee                                                                                                      & 6.72545 &   55\\\\\n",

The players take turns being robbers and exhibitors at a board game trade fair \\&mdash; rolling dice, lying, guessing, and shuffling cards.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The exhibitor tries to hide cash in one of the cash boxes and keep it hidden - shell game style. The robber secretly rolls a pair of dice and then tries to make increasingly risky moves to gain more information about the location of the cash and move the clerk away from the full cash box. If the exhibitor catches the thief in a lie, the thief must immediately risk stealing from a cash box without additional information.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3217446.jpg & 2 &   5 & 14 & 2 &  5 & Steal This Game                                                            &   5 & ... & Viktor Csete,Mihajlo Dimitrievski,Katalin Nimmerfroh      & Bluffing,Deduction,Dice                                        & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Dávid Turczi                                                            & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & NA                                                                                      & Dice Rolling,Memory                                                                                                                          & LudiCreations                                                                                                & 6.92760 &   50\\\\\n",

The player with the fewest minus points is the winner.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Exciting!\\&\\#10;Fun!\\&\\#10;Big Time!\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3227467.jpg & 4 &   0 &  8 & 2 & 20 & Take That                                                                  &   0 & ... & Oliver Freudenreich                                       & Card Game                                                      & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Andreas Spies,Reinhard Staupe                                           & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & NA                                                                                      & Hand Management,Take That                                                                                                                    & Nürnberger-Spielkarten-Verlag,White Goblin Games                                                             & 6.34615 &   52\\\\\n",
       "\t 212382 & In Yangtze, players are distributors on the Yangtze River, with each trying to make the most money there.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;On a turn, a player can take two actions, first selling one or more bundles of goods, then possibly purchasing a commodity. Goods on the Yangtze become cheaper and cheaper the further that they drift towards Shanghai. Whoever can wait a long time gets a chance to buy goods at a bargain price \\&mdash; assuming that another trader doesn't snatch those goods away first!\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Players don't need to rely solely on trade, however. They can also establish business branches that give them advantages during play, in addition to the half-dozen special cards that every player holds at the start of play.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3239043.jpg & 4 &  60 &  8 & 2 & 60 & Yangtze                                                                    &  60 & ... & Klemens Franz,Andrea Kattnig                              & NA                                                             & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Reiner Knizia                                                           & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & NA                                                                                      & Auction/Bidding,Set Collection                                                                                                               & Piatnik                                                                                                      & 6.71821 &   56\\\\\n",
       "\t 212445 & Description from the publisher:\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Blood Bowl is a game of Fantasy Football. The basic game features a match between two teams drawn from a number of fantasy archetypes, playing a warped version of American Football.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The Blood Bowl boxed game contains two teams: Humans, an all-round team who are flexible enough to adapt to any style of play, or Orcs, who make up in brute force what they lack in finesse. The teams are represented by coloured plastic miniatures, and push-fit assembly is required before use. The game is expandable, and additional rules and teams will be made available through expansion sets and supplements.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Actions in the game are resolved through the use of dice. Regular six-sided dice are used to make tests in a number of cases, such as when a player attempts to pick up the ball, pass it, catch it or dodge past an enemy player. Custom dice are used when one player wishes to Block another, using graphics to represent each of the different (but all violent) potential outcomes.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The rules in this edition of Blood Bowl are almost identical to those found in the Competition Rules Pack, which was the culmination of several years of development of the Blood Bowl Living Rulebook. This has resulted in an incredibly well-honed game which sees regular competition play around the world. In fact each team takes turns moving, blocking and advancing the football down the field. The game comes with plastic miniatures.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;This game is a part of the Blood Bowl Series.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3254491.jpg & 2 & 120 & 12 & 2 & 45 & Blood Bowl (2016 edition)                                                  & 120 & ... & Wayne England,David Gallagher,Pete Knifton,Richard Wright & Fantasy,Fighting,Miniatures,Sports                             & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Jervis Johnson                                                          & Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Blitzmania Special Play Promo Cards,Blood Bowl (2016 Edition): Blood on the Snow,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Bright Crusaders,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Death Roller,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Death Zone – Season One,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Dwarf Giants,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Go Full Beard Special Play Promo Card,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Goblin \\& Halfling Referee Rules,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Grak and Crumbleberry Star Players,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Griff Oberwald,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Grim Ironjaw,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Grombrindal and the Black Gobbo,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Hall of Fame Card Pack,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Morg 'N' Thorg,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Ogre,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Rat Ogre,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Reikland Reavers,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Skaven \\& Dwarf Pitch,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Special Ball Rules,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Team Titans Special Play Card Pack,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): The Early Bird Special Play Promo Card,Blood Bowl (2016 Edition): The Gouged Eye,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): The Mighty Zug,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): The Skavenblight Scramblers,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Troll,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Varag Ghoul-Chewer,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Winter Bowl Inducements & Blood Bowl,Fantasy Sports,Games Workshop Specialist Games,Warhammer Fantasy Board Games & Dice Rolling,Grid Movement,Variable Player Powers                                                                                            & Games Workshop Ltd.                                                                                          & 8.39254 &  632\\\\\n",

The player with the most points is the winner.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3258506.png & 2 &  15 & 12 & 2 & 15 & Qwixx: Das Duell                                                           &  15 & ... & NA                                                        & Dice                                                           & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Steffen Benndorf                                                        & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & NA                                                                                      & Dice Rolling                                                                                                                                 & Nürnberger-Spielkarten-Verlag,White Goblin Games                                                             & 6.73088 &   68\\\\\n",
       "\t 212956 & Description from the publisher:\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Trapped in a prison in which each room has four doors but apparently no exit, the players must try to find Room 25, the supposed exit to this nightmare. But some amongst them might be guardians of the prison, waiting for the right moment to strike.

       "\t 214996 & Description from the publisher:\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Silver Bayonet recreates the pivotal November 1965 battle between a full North Vietnamese Army Division and the US 1st Air Cavalry Division in the Ia Drang Valley. NVA expertise in lure and ambush tactics resulted in significant US casualties. US mobility and the ability to bring massive amounts of firepower to bear quickly virtually destroyed the attacking NVA division and forced a change in NVA tactics.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;This re-issue of GMT Games' 1990 CSR Award winning title that started it all keeps the original operational system, but streamlines to it to include innovative combat resolution integrating maneuver combat, close assault, artillery bombardment, and support from gunships and air sorties.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Increased accessibility to primary and secondary source material has made it possible to make changes to more accurately represent both sides' unique capabilities without significantly altering or breaking the base game system. The major changes involve patrols, ambushes, landing zones, and the 1st Cav Brigade HQ, while minor changes tweak movement, combat, and coordination game mechanics to showcase radically different strengths and weaknesses the FWA and NVA force brought to the battles in the Ia Drang Valley.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3093082.png & 2 & 480 & 12 & 1 & 30 & Silver Bayonet: The First Team in Vietnam, 1965 (25th Anniversary Edition) & 480 & ... & Charles Kibler                                            & Vietnam War,Wargame                                            & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Gene Billingsley,Mitchell Land                                          & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & GMT Operational System                                                                  & Hex-and-Counter                                                                                                                              & GMT Games                                                                                                    & 8.35333 &   75\\\\\n",

Players determine the exact composition of their armies as they play by adding cards to their deck based on the tech they've chosen to pursue.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3290122.jpg & 5 &  45 & 13 & 2 & 45 & Codex: Card-Time Strategy – Core Set                                       &  45 & ... & NA                                                        & Card Game,Fantasy,Fighting,Video Game Theme                    & NA                                                                                                                                                   & David Sirlin                                                            & Codex: Card-Time Strategy – Flagstone Dominion vs. Blackhand Scourge Expansion,Codex: Card-Time Strategy – Whitestar Order vs. Vortoss Conclave Expansion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & Fantasy Strike                                                                          & Deck / Pool Building,Hand Management,Variable Player Powers                                                                                  & Sirlin Games                                                                                                 & 8.08780 &   82\\\\\n",
       "\t 215471 & Time to walk about town and take some pictures! It's the 1960s in Japan, and you have a half-size camera that lets you take half-size vertical pictures. Let's see whether you can put together good shots...\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;In Wind the Film!, you're trying to organize pictures on your roll so that they appear in the right order. Each player has a hand of cards, and on a turn, you'll add 1-3 cards to the front of your hand (without changing their order), move one card in your hand closer to the front, then discard as many cards from the back of your hand as the number of cards that you added. When the sunset card comes out, you can take no more pictures, and everyone scores for what's on their camera.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The cards all have numbers and colors on them, and you try to line them up in hand to score the most points possible.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3290975.png & 4 &  20 & 12 & 2 & 20 & Wind the Film!                                                             &  20 & ... & <U+5B9D><U+4E95> <U+8CB4><U+5B50> (Takako Takarai)        & Card Game                                                      & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Saashi                                                                  & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & NA                                                                                      & Hand Management,Set Collection                                                                                                               & Saashi \\& Saashi                                                                                              & 7.28016 &   63\\\\\n",
       "\t 216201 & The race is on for the robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory who work long, hard days at the assembly line building high\\&\\#226;\\&\\#128;\\&\\#144;speed supercars, but never get to see them in action. On Saturday nights, the factory comes to life as the ultimate race course with treacherous obstacles and rival sabotage. In Robo Rally, players move their robots through the course by speeding through corridors and dodging traps to reach each checkpoint first. Only the strongest robots survive!\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;Enter the world of mad machines and dangerous schemes in the Robo Rally board game. Players control their robot with game cards which reveal directions on how the robots can move through the hectic Robo Rally automobile factory. Use strategy to outsmart rival robots while racing towards each checkpoint in your chosen course in numerical order. Beware of factory obstacles such as industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts that can make or break the race.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;The 2016 edition of Robo Rally differs from earlier versions in a number of ways:\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;    Players each now have their own deck of twenty cards, with the same cards in each deck. On a turn, a player draws nine cards from their deck, programs five of the cards, then discards the rest. Two cards says \\&quot;Again\\&quot; and repeat the action programmed in the previous slot; one card says \\&quot;Energy\\&quot; and gives a energy cube which you can use to buy options.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;     Since each player has their own deck, the cards no longer have priority numbers to determine who moves first. Now movement order is determined by whoever is closest to a transmitter on the game board.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;    Players start with a hand of three option cards and five energy. Each option card has an energy cost, and you can purchase additional option cards for the cost of two energy each. Players can earn energy by programming it, by being the first to a pitstop, or by starting their turn on a pitstop.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;    When players are damaged, they no longer receive one less card for each damage (or have one of their program registers locked) at the start of a round; instead they receive damage cards that will be shuffled into their decks. \\&quot;Normal\\&quot; damage from the board or a robot laser gives you \\&quot;spam\\&quot; damage. When you program one of these cards, you remove it from play at the appropriate time and replace it in the register with the top card from your deck. Surprise! Other types of damage exist, with a Trojan horse granting you two spam, a virus infecting nearby players, and a worm forcing you to reboot, which gives you even more damage. By playing the damage, though, you remove it from your deck.\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10;\\&\\#10; & //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3374227.jpg & 6 & 120 & 12 & 2 & 20 & Robo Rally (2016)                                                          & 120 & ... & NA                                                        & Miniatures,Racing,Science Fiction                              & NA                                                                                                                                                   & Richard Garfield                                                        & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & Robots                                                                                  & Action / Movement Programming,Grid Movement,Modular Board,Simultaneous Action Selection                                                      & Avalon Hill (Hasbro),Hasbro                                                                                  & 7.45871 &  341\\\\\n",

       "|  1 | Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 1986 edition featured 4 parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to 5 players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to 5 players and adds a shorter 5 round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Die Macher is #1 in the Valley Games Classic

       "|  2 | Dragonmaster is a trick-taking card game based on an older game called Coup d'etat. Each player is given a supply of plastic gems, which represent points. Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if &amp;quot;first&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;last&amp;quot; is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands. At the end, the biggest pile of gems wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Jewel contents:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;11 clear (3 extra)&amp;#10;13 green (1 extra)&amp;#10;22 red (2 extra)&amp;#10;22 blue (2 extra)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic184174.jpg  |  4 |  30 | 12 | 3 |  30 | Dragonmaster                |  30 | ... | Bob Pepper                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Card Game,Fantasy                                                            | NA                                                                                                              | G.

       "|  3 | Part of the Knizia tile-laying trilogy, Samurai is set in medieval Japan. Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha tokens scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions &amp;mdash; or all three at once! Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each token (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four tokens have been removed from play due to a tie for influence.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types. Ties are not uncommon and are broken based on the number of other, &amp;quot;non-majority&amp;quot; symbols each player has collected.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;

       "|  4 | When you see the triangular box and the luxurious, large blocks, you can tell this game was designed to be beautiful as well as functional.  The object of the game is to build pyramids out of the different colored blocks.  A pyramid scores more points when it's made from a few colors, but it's much harder to consistently outbid the other players for the necessary blocks.  The game is over when the Pharoah's Pyramid in the center is completed, which is built using all the blocks that the players don't use during the course of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Final round 1990

       "|  5 | In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher.  Some versions of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note: many books and websites list this as a 1962 publication. This is incorrect; information from Sid Sackson's diaries, correspondence, and royalty statements prove that it was published in 1964.  However, for some reason admins continue to accept &amp;quot;corrections&amp;quot; of the publication date to 1962.  A detailed timeline of the development and publication of the game can be found at https://opinionatedgamers.com/2014/05/29/how-acquire-became-acquire/, for those interested.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;

       "|  7 | In Cathedral, each player has a set of pieces of a different color. The pieces are in the shapes of buildings, covering from one to five square units. The first player takes the single neutral Cathedral piece and places it onto the board. Players then alternate placing one of their buildings onto the board until neither player can place another building. Players capture territory by surrounding areas that are occupied by at most one opponent or neutral building. A captured piece is removed and captured territory becomes off-limits to the opponent. The player with the fewest 'square units' of buildings that can't be placed wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic181642.jpg  |  2 |  20 |  8 | 2 |  20 | Cathedral                   |  20 | ... | S.

       "|  8 | In this interesting offering from Warfrog, players become Gods seeking to dominate a world with their followers.  The first part of the game involves constructing the game board, after which players take turns using cards to determine how many new people should appear and what type of terrain they will inhabit.  All tribes start off as barbarians, but soon the calming effect of civilization settles the marauding bands; although civilized tribes score more, they can no longer attack.  What they can do, though, is civilize other players' followers.  Sure it gives opponents more points, but at least those followers won't come after you!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;

       "|  9 | Although referred to as a sequel to El Grande, El Caballero shares few aspects with its namesake, being a fun but intense brain-burner in which players explore and attempt to control the lands and waterways of the New World.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players are following Columbus by exploring the islands he discovered. Players slowly explore the islands &amp;ndash; by picking and placing land tiles that are most favorable to them &amp;ndash; and discover wealth in the form of gold and fish. As they learn about the land and sea areas of this new land, they position their caballeros to try to maintain control of the important regions. Castillos give them a measure of protection from others, and ships allow them to establish trade and to fish for food. Success is measured in the size of land and sea areas they control.

       "| 10 | Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10; | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1798136.jpg |  6 |  60 | 10 | 2 |  60 | Elfenland                   |  60 | ... | Doris Matthäus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Fantasy,Travel                                                               | NA                                                                                                              | Alan R.

       "| 11 | Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cards are colorful depictions of beans in various descriptive poses, and the object is to make coins by planting fields (sets) of these beans and then harvesting them.  To help players match their cards up, the game features extensive trading and deal making.  One of the most unique features of the game is that you cannot rearrange your hand, as you need to play the cards in the order that you draw them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box.  One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean.  This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic69366.jpg   |  7 |  45 | 13 | 2 |  45 | Bohnanza                    |  45 | ... | Fréderic Bertrand,Marek Bláha,Andrea Boekhoff,Klemens Franz,Oliver Freudenreich,Inge George,Guido Hoffmann,Alexander Jung,Harald Lieske,Atelier Löwentor,Doris Matthäus,Björn Pertoft,Uwe Rosenberg,Johann Rüttinger,Barbara Stachuletz,Franz Vohwinkel,Markus Wagner | Card Game,Farming,Negotiation                                                | NA                                                                                                              | Uwe Rosenberg                                       | Auf der schwäb'schen Eisenbohn,Bohn Camillo,Bohnanza Erweiterungs-Set,Bohnanza Erweiterungs-Set (Revised Edition),Bohnanza: Amigo Bohnentaler,Bohnanza: Bean Market,Bohnanza: Bohnaparte &amp;

       "| 12 | Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.  Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns).  Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs.  Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.  The game lasts for three &amp;quot;epochs&amp;quot; (rounds).  The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the Box:&amp;#10;The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!&amp;#10;The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people.

       "| 13 | In Catan (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)&amp;mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone&amp;mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&amp;mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2419375.jpg |  4 | 120 | 10 | 3 |  60 | Catan                       | 120 | ... | Volkan Baga,Tanja Donner,Pete Fenlon,Jason Hawkins,Michaela Kienle,Harald Lieske,Michael Menzel,Marion Pott,Matt Schwabel,Franz Vohwinkel,Stephen Graham Walsh                                                                                                        | Negotiation                                                                  | CATAN 3D Collector's Edition,Catan: Big Box,Catan: Big Box,The Settlers of Catan: 15th Anniversary Wood Edition | Klaus Teuber                                        | 20 Jahre Darmstadt Spielt,Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015,Catakatoa,Catan Austria / Wien meets Catan,Catan Geographies: Austria,Catan Geographies: Bayern Edition,Catan Geographies: Corsica,Catan Geographies: Georgia,Catan Geographies: Kennessee,Catan Geographies: Mallorca,Catan Geographies: North Rhine – Westphalia,Catan Geographies: Settlers of Hesse,Catan Länderszenarien: Polen,Catan Länderszenarien: Rickshaw Run,Catan Scenarios: Big Game Big Honor,Catan Scenarios: Catanimals,Catan Scenarios: Frenemies,Catan Scenarios: Helpers of Catan,Catan Scenarios: Oil Springs,Catan Scenarios: Santa Claus,Catan World Championship Berlin 2014 Special,Catan: 5-6 Player Extension,Catan: 999 Games 25 jaar Expansion,Catan: Catan Day 2015 Exclusive Expansion,Catan: Cities &amp;

       "| 14 | Basari is a game of gem merchants competing in a marketplace&amp;quot;: racing, collecting, trading, and predicting what the other merchants will do.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To start the game, players receive 12 gemstones (3 each of 4 colors). &amp;#10;Each turn there will be a movement phase and an action phase:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For movement, everyone simultaneously rolls their die and moves their markers around a track.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;They then choose one of three different actions to perform. The actions are:&amp;#10;- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, &amp;#10;- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or &amp;#10;- to roll and move again and also collect points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Re-implemented by:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Edel, Stein &amp; Reich&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic48605.jpg   |  4 |  25 | 10 | 3 |  25 | Basari                      |  25 | ... | John Kovalic,Lüders &amp;

       "| 15 | By request of Fantasy Flight Games, Board Game Geek lists the various editions of Cosmic Encounter in separate entries. Each edition is the same game at its core, but the features, compatible expansions, and production differ among them. This entry is for the original 1977 Eon version.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players represent alien races that are seeking to spread themselves onto five foreign worlds.  To accomplish this, they make challenges against other players and enlist the aid of interested parties.  But alien powers, which are unique to each race, give players ways to bend or outright break some rule in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game continues until one player occupies five planets in other systems to win. Shared victories are possible and a player need not occupy one's own system to win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;

       "| 16 | Taking on the roles of shop owners in the Moroccan marketplace, players buy various shops, as color-coded tourists in the form of neat little wooden people in hats start showing up at the entry gate. Players can then move them into their own like-colored shops to earn money or move them into opponents' shops for a share of the profits. After all the tourists have been placed onto the board, the player with the biggest bankroll takes the victory. This game combines some great auction elements with spatial relationships for an appealing overall effect.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents:&amp;#10;  1 game board&amp;#10;  1 blue auction stone&amp;#10;  1

       "| 17 | This game gained a quick following after one of the major gaming conventions of 1999.  It features several characters, represented on actual stickpin buttons, that each have a unique allowance of polyhedral dice.  These dice endow each  character with fairly unique combat abilities.  Players roll the dice against each other and take their opponents' dice as casualties.  The object of the game is take out the most die 'sides' during the combat.  It's quite simple, quite inventive, and deeper than it would seem at first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic59279.jpg   |  2 |   5 | 10 | 2 |   5 | Button Men                  |   5 | ... | Pete Abrams,Gerald Brom,Larry Elmore,Phil Foglio,Ryan Kinnaird,John Kovalic,John Nephew,Michelle Nephew,Brian Snoddy,Cheyenne Wright,Andrew Yates                                                                                                                     | Collectible Components,Dice,Fighting,Print &amp;

       "| 18 | The robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line. They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &amp;quot;registers&amp;quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in

       "| 19 | A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing).  Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr&amp;uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp;amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &amp;quot;Wacky Water!&amp;quot; &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &amp;quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&amp;quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tiles-perhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;

       "| 20 | In this game of science fiction strip mining, players land on a planet and try and grab as much ore as possible and take off before the game is over.  Each player has tanks, boats, barges, mining equipment and a base ship at his disposal and will have to contend with the weather and the other miners.  The game uses an action point allowance system and thus is dice free.  Each player on his turn has a pool of points that he can divide in a variety of ways, putting all the points into one unit's movement or dividing them among several units.  Each turn is timed so players have to think quickly, and once a move has been made it cannot be retracted.  The game itself is beautifully put together, with a detailed hex grid and real metal miniatures for all of the units.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Online Play: &amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Full Metal Galaxy&amp;#10;

       "| 22 | From the 2nd edition rulebook intro for MAGIC REALM:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MAGIC REALM is a game of fantasy adventuring, set in a land filled with monsters, fabulous treasures, great warriors, and magicians. The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.&amp;#10;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.&amp;#10;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9&amp;#10;&amp;#10;See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic148345.jpg  | 16 | 240 | 12 | 1 | 240 | Magic Realm                 | 240 | ... | George Goebel,Kim Grommel,Richard Hamblen,Randall C.

       "| 26 | A game that is often described as a semi-sequel to Civilization.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players attempt to build up their cultures during the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods. The game features a card deck that holds events, payout cards, and famous leaders of the particular eras. Although all cards will turn up somewhere during the game, the timing and position in which they will be played is crucial and will ensure a different game every time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The main goal of each city-state is to gain points in the form of technical advances, while keeping their culture's misery level as low as possible. The payout structure is similar to those of Civilization and Advanced Civilization in that more resources of the same type yield increasingly higher payouts.

       "| 30 | An epic fantasy quest to recover an ancient magic scepter from a tyrant king in his Dark Tower, brought to life in electronic form.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To vanquish the usurper, players search the four realms of the circular game board for three keys to unlock the tower's gate.  On this journey, there are battles to be fought against roving bands of brigands, dragons, plague and hunger.  There are bazaars to visit to purchase supplies and assistants for the quest.  There are uncharted territories to get lost in and tombs and ruins to plunder.  And there is a mighty army to be raised before the player can lay seige to the tower and fight either to glorious victory or crushing defeat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dated and primitive by today's standards, Dark Tower was nevertheless an astonishing achievement when it was released in 1981.  Every aspect of the game was monitored by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself, an unheard of innovation at the time.  Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors.

       "| 31 | Along the lines of HeroQuest comes a much more heavily produced game called Dark World. One player is the evil lord who controls the dungeon in which the rest of the players move their characters from room to room, fighting monsters and gaining treasure. Real working treasure chests with magic weapons inside and the figures even get to put their new weapons in their character's hands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;

       "| 207336 | Honshu is a trick-taking, map-building card game set in feudal Japan. Players are lords and ladies of noble houses seeking new lands and opportunities for fame and fortune.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One game of Honshu lasts twelve rounds, and each round is divided into two phases. First, map cards are played in a trick, and the player who played the highest valued card gets to pick first from those cards played. Then the players use the map cards picked to expand their personal maps. Each player must expand their personal maps to maximize their scoring possibilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Manipulating your position in the player order is crucial for mastering Honshu.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3311364.jpg | 5 |  40 |  8 | 2 | 30 | Honshu                                                                     |  40 | ... | Ossi Hiekkala,Jere Kasanen                                | Card Game,City Building                                        | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Kalle Malmioja                                                          | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Asian Theme,Country: Japan                                                              | Hand Management,Tile Placement,Trick-taking                                                                                                  | Blackrock Games,Games 4 Gamers,HOT Games,Lautapelit.fi,Lucrum Games,playagame edizioni,Renegade Game Studios | 7.20114 |  790 |\n",
       "| 207338 | In Dungeon Rush, players are adventurers rushing through a perilous dungeon to root out evil, earning coins and improving their abilities along the way. After three levels (3 rounds of monsters in each level) they face the Dungeon Lord and the Dragon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has two heroes, one for your right and one for your left hand. Players simultaneously reveal 2 dungeon cards each and quickly put their hands on the cards they want their heroes to fight. If you win you claim the card as loot and/or equipment that increases the abilities of your hero. Equipment cards are placed partly under your hero card, with the ability symbol sticking out. This way the 4 different types of abilities (Melee, Ranged, Magic and Stealth) are built up in one direction each, out from your hero.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For particularly strong monsters your heroes can combine their power, by hitting the monster with both your hands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3149078.jpg | 5 |  19 |  8 | 2 | 13 | Dungeon Rush                                                               |  19 | ... | Lauri Bremer,Tuuli Hypén,Jere Kasanen                     | Card Game,Fantasy,Fighting,Humor,Real-time                     | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Rustan Håkansson,Eli Håkansson                                          | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | NA                                                                                      | Variable Player Powers                                                                                                                       | Lautapelit.fi,Lucrum Games,playagame edizioni,Stronghold Games                                               | 6.59226 |  133 |\n",
       "| 207487 | Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The tourist season is fast approaching. As a mansion owner, you've come to the Freak Shop to stock your mansion with the horrors that will guarantee that your visitors have a most unforgettable stay!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Freak Shop is a short and simple tactical card game for 2 to 5 players that relies on a tricky trade mechanism. All cards in the game represent the frightening things, with values going from 1 to 10, that any real good freaky mansion owner must have in their collection. Players begin with four cards in their mansion (personal area), and cards are available in the Freak Shop (common zone at the center of the table). Each player's aim is to have their mansion worth the most fear points when the Freak Shop closes, with points coming from a combination of three randomly chosen objectives. To achieve this, they try to make the best trades between cards currently in their mansion and cards available in the Shop so that their collection grows in both quantity and value, while also best fitting the objectives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn, you make one single trade between cards currently in your mansion and cards available in the Shop. To do that, you have the choice between two options:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Sell at the fair price =&amp;gt; Trade any number of cards totaling a given value for any number of cards worth exactly the same total value. &amp;#10;     Get a good deal =&amp;gt;  Exchange a series of cards of one single value with a series of the same number of cards of another single value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Throughout a game of Freak Shop, you try to take the best trade opportunities each turn to first make your mansion grow, then ensure that you can end with the collection worth the most points. Good deals help to get higher value cards, and fair price trades help to get more cards in your mansion. As everything is about trades, a central strategic point is to determine which cards are better used for optimizing new trades instead of being kept for scoring!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3152633.jpg | 5 |  30 |  8 | 2 | 15 | Freak Shop                                                                 |  30 | ... | Miguel Coimbra                                            | Card Game                                                      | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Henri Kermarrec                                                         | Freak Shop: Card \"13\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | NA                                                                                      | Set Collection,Trading                                                                                                                       | Catch Up Games                                                                                               | 6.70659 |   82 |\n",
       "| 207691 | Ambition and a thirst for wealth have driven humanity to strive for ever greater progress. In America, during the 19th century, battles were waged between huge railway corporations that sought to connect state to state and coast with coast&amp;hellip; making themselves filthy rich in the process. Railroad Revolution drops you straight into the middle of these tempestuous years; a time that changed America forever.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Railroad Revolution, you will manage your own railroad company, ruthlessly competing to be the most powerful railroad tycoon across all America. You will build railroads, establish stations in your connected cities, expand the network of telegraph lines, and chase your objectives, increasing the value of your company with every action you take.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You start with mainly a team of non-specialized workers, but during the game you can hire additional ones with specific skill sets. The cost or effect of an action is determined by the type of worker that does it. To complete your company objectives, you will have to remove some of your workers from your active pool, promoting them to managerial positions. You must carefully assign each of your workers to perform the right action at the right time in order to exploit their specializations in the best way. You need to decide which ones to promote and which are instead still needed to take actions, as your priorities will change from turn to turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Railroad Revolution is a fast paced game with relatively simple rules, and it provides you with interesting and challenging decisions. Having a good strategy and finding the correct timing to implement it, is the key to winning the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3200781.jpg | 4 |  90 | 12 | 2 | 45 | Railroad Revolution                                                        |  90 | ... | Mariano Iannelli                                          | Trains                                                         | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Marco Canetta,Stefania Niccolini                                        | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | NA                                                                                      | Route/Network Building                                                                                                                       | hobbity.eu,Pegasus Spiele,Red Glove,What's Your Game?                                                        | 7.58073 | 1023 |\n",
       "| 207919 | In Hounded, players will either be the cunning fox, trying to elude capture, or the determined hunter, trying to hunt down the fox.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game. each player moves their pawns and turns over tiles as they do, sometimes triggering effects and sometimes not. While the fox character is alone, the hunter has a team of hounds to help him hunt the fox. All the hunter has to do to win is either corner the fox with his dogs or force the fox to end his turn next to the hunter himself. For the fox to win, it has to run out the clock, which is done by either finding the three timepiece tiles or flipping over 43 of the 49 tiles. Once time runs out, the hunter has to retire for the day and the fox escapes!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3166848.jpg | 2 |  25 | 13 | 2 | 15 | Hounded                                                                    |  25 | ... | Clint Bohaty                                              | Abstract Strategy,Animals                                      | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Clint Bohaty                                                            | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Animals: Dogs,Animals: Foxes,Sports: Hunting                                            | Point to Point Movement,Variable Player Powers                                                                                               | Atlas Games                                                                                                  | 7.26056 |   71 |\n",
       "| 208217 | After many millennia, Hypnos is leaving the throne. Now it belongs to the Morpheus, Hypnos' right hand and son. Morpheus must make sure that dreams leave Oniria to the world and minds of mortals at the same rate as to this moment, otherwise Earth is doomed to regress of thinking and Oniria &amp;ndash; to annihilation. Mortals need dreams to think, remember and stimulate their imagination, Oniria needs sleeping humans to exist &amp;ndash; without dreamers Oniria will be left without power. But Morpheus cannot rule Kingdom of Dreams and create dreams and send them alone. That is why he needs an assistant.  He makes a competition &amp;ndash; Dreamweavers have three months (this is rather foggy, time in Oniria works &amp;ndash; like most things &amp;ndash; differently than in mortal world) to weave the most dreams with the most powerful oniric energies &amp;ndash; the best weaver will become Morpheus&amp;rsquo; right hand, and simultaneously second most powerful creature in Oniria.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Morpheus is a game for 2-4 players in which players will create dreams. At the beginning of each turn, the active player rolls the dice. Then, players will choose the dice and according to the number they will get different gifts, with essence among them. After that, at certain locations Dreamweavers can assign the essence to dreams and completing them. Other gifts include Chronite, a rare mineral able to bend time, used as a currency and Onirite, a device which can bend the structure of Oniria, allowing players to take additional actions. Dreamweavers will travel through the land of Oniria exactly three months of game-time, which equals 21 turns. The board is randomly assembled from tiles and dreamweavers will go a full circle from location to location.

Each player sees the clues &amp;mdash; person + location + weapon &amp;mdash; for the other players but not their own. They investigate by asking questions, by consulting the secret informant, and by making accusations in order to collect clues and rule out suspects. The goal of the game is to identify which of the 13 clues match their case before the others do!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3175792.png | 6 |  30 |  8 | 2 | 30 | 13 Clues                                                                   |  30 | ... | Giacomo Tappainer                                         | Deduction                                                      | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Andrés J.

       "| 208773 | Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Quartermaster General: 1914 is the next title in the critically acclaimed Quartermaster General series by Ian Brody and creates a narrative of the First World War in Europe, reflecting the military, technological, and social changes that occurred over the following four years.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Quartermaster General: 1914, each card has two different uses: one when played, and another when prepared. On your turn, you have the opportunity to both play and prepare a card. You can also spend cards to draft more troops, or use cards to attrition your opponents. However, your deck represents your overall resources, so moving too quickly through your deck early might result in your unsupported armies being swept away in the final rounds of the game. This is worth it if you can capture Berlin or Paris in 1915, but if your gambit fails, you may have a tough road ahead.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends after 17 rounds of play, or earlier if one side has a commanding lead.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3183517.jpg | 5 | 120 | 12 | 2 | 90 | Quartermaster General: 1914                                                | 120 | ... | Nicholas Avallone                                         | Wargame,World War I                                            | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Ian Brody                                                               | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Quartermaster Series                                                                    | Area Control / Area Influence,Campaign / Battle Card Driven,Card Drafting,Co-operative Play,Deck / Pool Building,Hand Management             | PSC Games                                                                                                    | 7.93394 |  193 |\n",
       "| 208775 | This is a new edition of the Spiel des Jahres-nominated dice game.  In this version everything is bigger, the players have boards with dry erase markers in place of the original paper and pencil.  This edition is also for up to 8 players instead of only 5 in the original game.  The biggest change in this edition, though, is that on the back of the regular player boards are the Qwixx Mixx boards which have the colors scrambled throughout the different lines, which changes many of the strategies while keeping the mechanisms largely the same.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules for Qwixx:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Qwixx is a quick-playing dice game in which everyone participates, no matter whose turn it is. Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, the active player rolls six dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows, then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that's the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you mark off the 2 or 12 in a row and have at least five numbers marked in that row, you get to also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box. Whoever has the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3264158.jpg | 8 |   0 |  8 | 2 | 20 | Qwixx Deluxe                                                               |   0 | ... | NA                                                        | Dice                                                           | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Steffen Benndorf                                                        | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | NA                                                                                      | Dice Rolling                                                                                                                                 | Gamewright                                                                                                   | 7.24785 |  149 |\n",
       "| 209010 | Mechs vs. Minions is a cooperative tabletop campaign for 2-4 players. Set in the world of Runeterra, players take on the roles of four intrepid Yordles: Corki, Tristana, Heimerdinger, and Ziggs, who must join forces and pilot their newly-crafted mechs against an army of marauding minions. With modular boards, programmatic command lines, and a story-driven campaign, each mission will be unique, putting your teamwork, programming, and piloting skills to the test.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are ten missions in total, and each individual mission will take about 60-90 minutes. The box includes five game boards, four command lines (one for each player), four painted mech miniatures, ability and damage decks, a sand timer, a bomb-like-power source miniature, 6 metal trackers, 4 acrylic shards, 4 dice, and 100 minion miniatures.  There also appears to be some large object trying to get out of that sealed box...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3184103.jpg | 4 |  90 | 14 | 2 | 60 | Mechs vs. Minions                                                          |  90 | ... | Danny Beck,Tysen Henderson                                | Fantasy,Fighting,Miniatures,Video Game Theme                   | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Chris Cantrell,Rick Ernst,Stone Librande,Prashant Saraswat,Nathan Tiras | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Campaign Games,Components: Miniatures                                                   | Action / Movement Programming,Card Drafting,Co-operative Play,Dice Rolling,Modular Board,Variable Player Powers                              | Riot Games                                                                                                   | 8.37548 | 4602 |\n",
       "| 209166 | Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Following the call of the gods, the players settle at the base of mountain Meduris. Building huts, bringing offerings to the druid, gathering precious runestones, and building monumental temples is the only way to earn the favor of the gods in Meduris.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Skillful use of the workers lets you obtain valuable materials. These are needed to build huts and temples.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. The larger the settlement,the more expensive it is to build a hut there. But if you can get in the good graces of the druid by presenting an offering, then your effort pays off.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. Keep an eye on the other players: Who will secure the best building sites at the right time, and collect the most valuable rune stones?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4. Only a player who skillfully places their huts and temples, and keeps enough materials ready for the big final round of offerings, will win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;Dem Ruf der G&amp;ouml;tter folgend, machen sich die Spieler auf, um den Fu&amp;szlig; des Berges M&amp;eacute;duris zu besiedeln.

All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.'&amp;quot;'&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dominion is not a collectible card game (CCG), but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 26 Kingdom card types to include in any given play&amp;mdash;leading to immense variety.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dominion (Second Edition) replaces six Kingdom card types from the first edition with six new types of Kingdom cards, while also replacing the blank cards in the game with a seventh new Kingdom card. These new cards are available on their own in the Dominion: Update Pack. The rulebook has been rewritten, three cards have mild functional changes (&amp;quot;you may&amp;quot; added to Moneylender, Mine, Throne Room), and other cards have been rephrased (while remaining functionally the same).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dominion: Update Pack contains the seven new kingdom cards introduced in the second edition of Dominion, thereby allowing owners of the first edition to obtain these new cards without needing to repurchase the entire game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3187001.jpg | 4 |  30 | 14 | 2 | 30 | Dominion (Second Edition)                                                  |  30 | ... | Julien Delval                                             | Card Game,Medieval                                             | Dominion: Update Pack,Dominion (Second Edition) Big Box                                                                                              | Donald X.

       "| 209530 | Gwent is a standalone card game included inside the Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt videogame by CD Projekt Red. It was available as a physical copy with the Xbox One Collector's Edition of the video game (Northern Realms and Nilfgaardian Empire factions), in &amp;quot;Hearts of Stone&amp;quot;physical expansion for PC/PS4 (Scoia'Tel and Monsters factions) and with the purchase of the Season Pass giving you the opportunity to ask for redeem code to buy both limited editions versions on CD Projekt Red merchandising store.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gwent has two players simulating a war between two of four factions: Northern Realms, Scoia'Tael, Monsters, or Nilfgaardian Empire. Players take turns adding strength to the battlefield until both players pass. The highest strength on the battlefield wins the round and matches are played best of three, with little to no card drawing in between rounds. Special cards may also be played to reduce the effect of certain unit types.

       "| 210101 | Incorporated is a strategy game of economic warfare, a simulation of modern-day markets, economics and politics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Incorporated places you as the CEO of a multi-national corporation whose aim is to profit no matter the cost. You acquire smaller corporations in global stock markets, borrow from debt markets to finance your investments, use superpowers like a pawn to invade third world countries and take their oil, lobby the governments to grant you more subsidies and compete with other mega-corporations for leadership in market share.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Uncontrollably, the world is not in its most stable state either. Chances of a global economic crisis or geopolitical power shifts may ruin your investments.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is set in a complex and dynamic global economy, where profitable industries, interest rates, global growth and geopolitical landscape change constantly and the scepter of an economic crisis always present. Players must analyze and influence these new trends. The world's superpowers may compete for world dominance but you care little about the grand chessboard, except when your profits are concerned!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3276023.jpg | 4 | 180 | 16 | 2 | 80 | Incorporated                                                               | 180 | ... | Cem Akkartal,Sebastian Koziner                            | Economic,Political,Wargame                                     | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Can Adatepe                                                             | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | NA                                                                                      | Area Control / Area Influence,Auction/Bidding,Stock Holding,Worker Placement                                                                 | (Self-Published),TCA Games                                                                                   | 7.60694 |   72 |\n",
       "| 210342 | Timeline: British History is a card game played using 109 cards. Each card depicts an event on both sides, with the year in which that it occured on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Timeline: British History can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3225966.jpg | 8 |  30 |  8 | 2 | 15 | Timeline: British History                                                  |  30 | ... | Xavier Collette,Nicolas Fructus                           | Card Game                                                      | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Frédéric Henry                                                          | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Timeline                                                                                | NA                                                                                                                                           | Asmodee                                                                                                      | 6.72545 |   55 |\n",
       "| 211047 | Steal This Game was designed by D&amp;aacute;vid Turczi on the spot at SPIEL 2016 after an unfortunate incident left the publisher a full cash box short.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This nanogame, playable by two players in five minutes or less, fits on a postcard (with two dice supplied by the players). The players take turns being robbers and exhibitors at a board game trade fair &amp;mdash; rolling dice, lying, guessing, and shuffling cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The exhibitor tries to hide cash in one of the cash boxes and keep it hidden - shell game style. The robber secretly rolls a pair of dice and then tries to make increasingly risky moves to gain more information about the location of the cash and move the clerk away from the full cash box. If the exhibitor catches the thief in a lie, the thief must immediately risk stealing from a cash box without additional information.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3217446.jpg | 2 |   5 | 14 | 2 |  5 | Steal This Game                                                            |   5 | ... | Viktor Csete,Mihajlo Dimitrievski,Katalin Nimmerfroh      | Bluffing,Deduction,Dice                                        | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Dávid Turczi                                                            | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | NA                                                                                      | Dice Rolling,Memory                                                                                                                          | LudiCreations                                                                                                | 6.92760 |   50 |\n",

Great take that fun game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn, you have to place down a card into the row or remove one. That&amp;acute;s all.&amp;#10;But beware! If you can not do it either way, you have to swallow this bitter pill. &amp;#10;In this case the bitter toad and cash in minus points - but tidy many.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the stack of cards is empty, the game ends. The player with the fewest minus points is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Exciting!&amp;#10;Fun!&amp;#10;Big Time!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3227467.jpg | 4 |   0 |  8 | 2 | 20 | Take That                                                                  |   0 | ... | Oliver Freudenreich                                       | Card Game                                                      | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Andreas Spies,Reinhard Staupe                                           | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | NA                                                                                      | Hand Management,Take That                                                                                                                    | Nürnberger-Spielkarten-Verlag,White Goblin Games                                                             | 6.34615 |   52 |\n",
       "| 212382 | In Yangtze, players are distributors on the Yangtze River, with each trying to make the most money there.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, a player can take two actions, first selling one or more bundles of goods, then possibly purchasing a commodity. Goods on the Yangtze become cheaper and cheaper the further that they drift towards Shanghai. Whoever can wait a long time gets a chance to buy goods at a bargain price &amp;mdash; assuming that another trader doesn't snatch those goods away first!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players don't need to rely solely on trade, however. They can also establish business branches that give them advantages during play, in addition to the half-dozen special cards that every player holds at the start of play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3239043.jpg | 4 |  60 |  8 | 2 | 60 | Yangtze                                                                    |  60 | ... | Klemens Franz,Andrea Kattnig                              | NA                                                             | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Reiner Knizia                                                           | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | NA                                                                                      | Auction/Bidding,Set Collection                                                                                                               | Piatnik                                                                                                      | 6.71821 |   56 |\n",
       "| 212445 | Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Blood Bowl is a game of Fantasy Football. The basic game features a match between two teams drawn from a number of fantasy archetypes, playing a warped version of American Football.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Blood Bowl boxed game contains two teams: Humans, an all-round team who are flexible enough to adapt to any style of play, or Orcs, who make up in brute force what they lack in finesse. The teams are represented by coloured plastic miniatures, and push-fit assembly is required before use. The game is expandable, and additional rules and teams will be made available through expansion sets and supplements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Actions in the game are resolved through the use of dice. Regular six-sided dice are used to make tests in a number of cases, such as when a player attempts to pick up the ball, pass it, catch it or dodge past an enemy player. Custom dice are used when one player wishes to Block another, using graphics to represent each of the different (but all violent) potential outcomes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules in this edition of Blood Bowl are almost identical to those found in the Competition Rules Pack, which was the culmination of several years of development of the Blood Bowl Living Rulebook. This has resulted in an incredibly well-honed game which sees regular competition play around the world. In fact each team takes turns moving, blocking and advancing the football down the field. The game comes with plastic miniatures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is a part of the Blood Bowl Series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3254491.jpg | 2 | 120 | 12 | 2 | 45 | Blood Bowl (2016 edition)                                                  | 120 | ... | Wayne England,David Gallagher,Pete Knifton,Richard Wright | Fantasy,Fighting,Miniatures,Sports                             | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Jervis Johnson                                                          | Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Blitzmania Special Play Promo Cards,Blood Bowl (2016 Edition): Blood on the Snow,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Bright Crusaders,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Death Roller,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Death Zone – Season One,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Dwarf Giants,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Go Full Beard Special Play Promo Card,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Goblin &amp; Halfling Referee Rules,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Grak and Crumbleberry Star Players,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Griff Oberwald,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Grim Ironjaw,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Grombrindal and the Black Gobbo,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Hall of Fame Card Pack,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Morg 'N' Thorg,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Ogre,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Rat Ogre,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Reikland Reavers,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Skaven &amp; Dwarf Pitch,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Special Ball Rules,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Team Titans Special Play Card Pack,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): The Early Bird Special Play Promo Card,Blood Bowl (2016 Edition): The Gouged Eye,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): The Mighty Zug,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): The Skavenblight Scramblers,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Troll,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Varag Ghoul-Chewer,Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Winter Bowl Inducements | Blood Bowl,Fantasy Sports,Games Workshop Specialist Games,Warhammer Fantasy Board Games | Dice Rolling,Grid Movement,Variable Player Powers                                                                                            | Games Workshop Ltd.                                                                                          | 8.39254 |  632 |\n",
       "| 212551 | Qwixx: Das Duell is a stand alone two player version of Qwixx.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As in Qwixx, players roll colored dice and match them up to fill out a score sheet to maximize how many points they will score at the end of the game. However in this game, rolls can only be used by the active player, but the players will share the same score board and mark their progression with stones of their player color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Stones can in some cases be &amp;quot;bumped&amp;quot; out by the other player, while other stones are &amp;quot;locked&amp;quot; in permanently. As so, Qwixx: Das Duell features a higher level of player interaction than Qwixx.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the game, players sum up their scores based on the placent of their stones. The player with the most points is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3258506.png | 2 |  15 | 12 | 2 | 15 | Qwixx: Das Duell                                                           |  15 | ... | NA                                                        | Dice                                                           | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Steffen Benndorf                                                        | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | NA                                                                                      | Dice Rolling                                                                                                                                 | Nürnberger-Spielkarten-Verlag,White Goblin Games                                                             | 6.73088 |   68 |\n",

But some amongst them might be guardians of the prison, waiting for the right moment to strike.

       "| 214996 | Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Silver Bayonet recreates the pivotal November 1965 battle between a full North Vietnamese Army Division and the US 1st Air Cavalry Division in the Ia Drang Valley. NVA expertise in lure and ambush tactics resulted in significant US casualties. US mobility and the ability to bring massive amounts of firepower to bear quickly virtually destroyed the attacking NVA division and forced a change in NVA tactics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This re-issue of GMT Games' 1990 CSR Award winning title that started it all keeps the original operational system, but streamlines to it to include innovative combat resolution integrating maneuver combat, close assault, artillery bombardment, and support from gunships and air sorties.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Increased accessibility to primary and secondary source material has made it possible to make changes to more accurately represent both sides' unique capabilities without significantly altering or breaking the base game system. The major changes involve patrols, ambushes, landing zones, and the 1st Cav Brigade HQ, while minor changes tweak movement, combat, and coordination game mechanics to showcase radically different strengths and weaknesses the FWA and NVA force brought to the battles in the Ia Drang Valley.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3093082.png | 2 | 480 | 12 | 1 | 30 | Silver Bayonet: The First Team in Vietnam, 1965 (25th Anniversary Edition) | 480 | ... | Charles Kibler                                            | Vietnam War,Wargame                                            | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Gene Billingsley,Mitchell Land                                          | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | GMT Operational System                                                                  | Hex-and-Counter                                                                                                                              | GMT Games                                                                                                    | 8.35333 |   75 |\n",

Players each control three different heroes and have access to a tech tree that allows them to use different strategies each time they play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of the game is to destroy the opponent's base. To do this, players build up an army of units and heroes. Players determine the exact composition of their armies as they play by adding cards to their deck based on the tech they've chosen to pursue.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3290122.jpg | 5 |  45 | 13 | 2 | 45 | Codex: Card-Time Strategy – Core Set                                       |  45 | ... | NA                                                        | Card Game,Fantasy,Fighting,Video Game Theme                    | NA                                                                                                                                                   | David Sirlin                                                            | Codex: Card-Time Strategy – Flagstone Dominion vs. Blackhand Scourge Expansion,Codex: Card-Time Strategy – Whitestar Order vs. Vortoss Conclave Expansion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Fantasy Strike                                                                          | Deck / Pool Building,Hand Management,Variable Player Powers                                                                                  | Sirlin Games                                                                                                 | 8.08780 |   82 |\n",
       "| 215471 | Time to walk about town and take some pictures! It's the 1960s in Japan, and you have a half-size camera that lets you take half-size vertical pictures. Let's see whether you can put together good shots...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Wind the Film!, you're trying to organize pictures on your roll so that they appear in the right order. Each player has a hand of cards, and on a turn, you'll add 1-3 cards to the front of your hand (without changing their order), move one card in your hand closer to the front, then discard as many cards from the back of your hand as the number of cards that you added. When the sunset card comes out, you can take no more pictures, and everyone scores for what's on their camera.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cards all have numbers and colors on them, and you try to line them up in hand to score the most points possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3290975.png | 4 |  20 | 12 | 2 | 20 | Wind the Film!                                                             |  20 | ... | &lt;U+5B9D&gt;&lt;U+4E95&gt; &lt;U+8CB4&gt;&lt;U+5B50&gt; (Takako Takarai)        | Card Game                                                      | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Saashi                                                                  | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | NA                                                                                      | Hand Management,Set Collection                                                                                                               | Saashi &amp; Saashi                                                                                              | 7.28016 |   63 |\n",
       "| 216201 | The race is on for the robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory who work long, hard days at the assembly line building high&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#144;speed supercars, but never get to see them in action. On Saturday nights, the factory comes to life as the ultimate race course with treacherous obstacles and rival sabotage. In Robo Rally, players move their robots through the course by speeding through corridors and dodging traps to reach each checkpoint first. Only the strongest robots survive!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Enter the world of mad machines and dangerous schemes in the Robo Rally board game. Players control their robot with game cards which reveal directions on how the robots can move through the hectic Robo Rally automobile factory. Use strategy to outsmart rival robots while racing towards each checkpoint in your chosen course in numerical order. Beware of factory obstacles such as industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts that can make or break the race.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2016 edition of Robo Rally differs from earlier versions in a number of ways:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Players each now have their own deck of twenty cards, with the same cards in each deck. On a turn, a player draws nine cards from their deck, programs five of the cards, then discards the rest. Two cards says &amp;quot;Again&amp;quot; and repeat the action programmed in the previous slot; one card says &amp;quot;Energy&amp;quot; and gives a energy cube which you can use to buy options.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Since each player has their own deck, the cards no longer have priority numbers to determine who moves first. Now movement order is determined by whoever is closest to a transmitter on the game board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Players start with a hand of three option cards and five energy. Each option card has an energy cost, and you can purchase additional option cards for the cost of two energy each. Players can earn energy by programming it, by being the first to a pitstop, or by starting their turn on a pitstop.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    When players are damaged, they no longer receive one less card for each damage (or have one of their program registers locked) at the start of a round; instead they receive damage cards that will be shuffled into their decks. &amp;quot;Normal&amp;quot; damage from the board or a robot laser gives you &amp;quot;spam&amp;quot; damage. When you program one of these cards, you remove it from play at the appropriate time and replace it in the register with the top card from your deck. Surprise! Other types of damage exist, with a Trojan horse granting you two spam, a virus infecting nearby players, and a worm forcing you to reboot, which gives you even more damage. By playing the damage, though, you remove it from your deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; | //cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3374227.jpg | 6 | 120 | 12 | 2 | 20 | Robo Rally (2016)                                                          | 120 | ... | NA                                                        | Miniatures,Racing,Science Fiction                              | NA                                                                                                                                                   | Richard Garfield                                                        | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Robots                                                                                  | Action / Movement Programming,Grid Movement,Modular Board,Simultaneous Action Selection                                                      | Avalon Hill (Hasbro),Hasbro                                                                                  | 7.45871 |  341 |\n",

       "1     Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The 1986 edition featured 4 parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to 5 players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to 5 players and adds a shorter 5 round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&#10;&#10;Die Macher is #1 in the Valley Games Classic Line&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "2     Dragonmaster is a trick-taking card game based on an older game called Coup d'etat. Each player is given a supply of plastic gems, which represent points. Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if &quot;first&quot; or &quot;last&quot; is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands. At the end, the biggest pile of gems wins the game.&#10;&#10;Jewel contents:&#10;&#10;11 clear (3 extra)&#10;13 green (1 extra)&#10;22 red (2 extra)&#10;22 blue (2 extra)&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "3     Part of the Knizia tile-laying trilogy, Samurai is set in medieval Japan. Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha tokens scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions &mdash; or all three at once! Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each token (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group.&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four tokens have been removed from play due to a tie for influence.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types. Ties are not uncommon and are broken based on the number of other, &quot;non-majority&quot; symbols each player has collected.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "4     When you see the triangular box and the luxurious, large blocks, you can tell this game was designed to be beautiful as well as functional.  The object of the game is to build pyramids out of the different colored blocks.  A pyramid scores more points when it's made from a few colors, but it's much harder to consistently outbid the other players for the necessary blocks.  The game is over when the Pharoah's Pyramid in the center is completed, which is built using all the blocks that the players don't use during the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Final round 1990 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "5     In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.&#10;&#10;This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher.

Players produce a score of different commodities to trade with other cities in the hope of creating enough income to fill their capitals with buildings, produce artwork, and fill warehouses with goods.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "7     In Cathedral, each player has a set of pieces of a different color. The pieces are in the shapes of buildings, covering from one to five square units. The first player takes the single neutral Cathedral piece and places it onto the board. Players then alternate placing one of their buildings onto the board until neither player can place another building. Players capture territory by surrounding areas that are occupied by at most one opponent or neutral building. A captured piece is removed and captured territory becomes off-limits to the opponent. The player with the fewest 'square units' of buildings that can't be placed wins.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "8     In this interesting offering from Warfrog, players become Gods seeking to dominate a world with their followers.  The first part of the game involves constructing the game board, after which players take turns using cards to determine how many new people should appear and what type of terrain they will inhabit.  All tribes start off as barbarians, but soon the calming effect of civilization settles the marauding bands; although civilized tribes score more, they can no longer attack.  What they can do, though, is civilize other players' followers.  Sure it gives opponents more points, but at least those followers won't come after you!&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "9     Although referred to as a sequel to El Grande, El Caballero shares few aspects with its namesake, being a fun but intense brain-burner in which players explore and attempt to control the lands and waterways of the New World.&#10;&#10;The players are following Columbus by exploring the islands he discovered. Players slowly explore the islands &ndash; by picking and placing land tiles that are most favorable to them &ndash; and discover wealth in the form of gold and fish. As they learn about the land and sea areas of this new land, they position their caballeros to try to maintain control of the important regions. Castillos give them a measure of protection from others, and ships allow them to establish trade and to fish for food. Success is measured in the size of land and sea areas they control. Their success is measured twice, and in the end these scores are summed and the winner declared.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "10    Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&#10;  &#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&#10;&#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&#10;&#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&#10;&#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.&#10;&#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;\n",
       "11    Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions.&#10;&#10;The cards are colorful depictions of beans in various descriptive poses, and the object is to make coins by planting fields (sets) of these beans and then harvesting them.  To help players match their cards up, the game features extensive trading and deal making.  One of the most unique features of the game is that you cannot rearrange your hand, as you need to play the cards in the order that you draw them.&#10;&#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players.&#10;&#10;The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box.  One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean.  This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "12    Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.  Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns).  Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs.  Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.  The game lasts for three &quot;epochs&quot; (rounds).  The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play.&#10;&#10;From the Box:&#10;The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!&#10;The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people. Ra is an auction and set collecting game where players may choose to take risks for great rewards or...

       "13    In Catan (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)&mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone&mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.&#10;&#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&#10;&#10;Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&#10;&#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "14    Basari is a game of gem merchants competing in a marketplace&quot;: racing, collecting, trading, and predicting what the other merchants will do.&#10;&#10;To start the game, players receive 12 gemstones (3 each of 4 colors). &#10;Each turn there will be a movement phase and an action phase:&#10;&#10;For movement, everyone simultaneously rolls their die and moves their markers around a track.&#10;&#10;They then choose one of three different actions to perform. The actions are:&#10;- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, &#10;- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or &#10;- to roll and move again and also collect points.&#10;&#10;The action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.&#10;&#10;A new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Edel, Stein & Reich&#10;&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "16    Taking on the roles of shop owners in the Moroccan marketplace, players buy various shops, as color-coded tourists in the form of neat little wooden people in hats start showing up at the entry gate. Players can then move them into their own like-colored shops to earn money or move them into opponents' shops for a share of the profits. After all the tourists have been placed onto the board, the player with the biggest bankroll takes the victory. This game combines some great auction elements with spatial relationships for an appealing overall effect.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;  1 game board&#10;  1 blue auction stone&#10;  1 counter sheet with:&#10;      - 24 shop signs (6 each of Ali, Anfa, Omar and Leila)&#10;      -   4 player aid cards&#10;24  plastic stands&#10;54 pawns = &quot;visitors&quot; (14 yellow, 10 each of red, blue, green and purple)&#10;25 game cards with &quot;souvenirs&quot;&#10;Money in different values (500, 200, 100 and 25 Dirhams)&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "17    This game gained a quick following after one of the major gaming conventions of 1999.  It features several characters, represented on actual stickpin buttons, that each have a unique allowance of polyhedral dice.  These dice endow each  character with fairly unique combat abilities.  Players roll the dice against each other and take their opponents' dice as casualties.  The object of the game is take out the most die 'sides' during the combat.  It's quite simple, quite inventive, and deeper than it would seem at first.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "18    The robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line. They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "19    A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing).  Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.&#10;&#10;Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:&#10;&#10;Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr&uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &quot;Wacky Water!&quot; &#10;&#10;&#10;Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....&#10;&#10;&#10;In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tiles-perhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "20    In this game of science fiction strip mining, players land on a planet and try and grab as much ore as possible and take off before the game is over.  Each player has tanks, boats, barges, mining equipment and a base ship at his disposal and will have to contend with the weather and the other miners.  The game uses an action point allowance system and thus is dice free.  Each player on his turn has a pool of points that he can divide in a variety of ways, putting all the points into one unit's movement or dividing them among several units.  Each turn is timed so players have to think quickly, and once a move has been made it cannot be retracted.  The game itself is beautifully put together, with a detailed hex grid and real metal miniatures for all of the units.&#10;&#10;Online Play: &#10;&#10;    Full Metal Galaxy&#10;    Full Metal Program&#10;    VASSAL module&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Full Metal Conqu&#195;&#170;te (as a two-player version)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Full Metal Planete: Plateau Modulaire.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadges:&#10; - Full Metal Plan&egrave;te fan  Buy It&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "21    From the 2nd edition rulebook intro for MAGIC REALM:&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a game of fantasy adventuring, set in a land filled with monsters, fabulous treasures, great warriors, and magicians. The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.&#10;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.&#10;&#10;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.&#10;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.&#10;&#10;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9&#10;&#10;See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "25    A game that is often described as a semi-sequel to Civilization.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to build up their cultures during the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods. The game features a card deck that holds events, payout cards, and famous leaders of the particular eras. Although all cards will turn up somewhere during the game, the timing and position in which they will be played is crucial and will ensure a different game every time.&#10;&#10;The main goal of each city-state is to gain points in the form of technical advances, while keeping their culture's misery level as low as possible.

       "29    An epic fantasy quest to recover an ancient magic scepter from a tyrant king in his Dark Tower, brought to life in electronic form.&#10;&#10;To vanquish the usurper, players search the four realms of the circular game board for three keys to unlock the tower's gate.  On this journey, there are battles to be fought against roving bands of brigands, dragons, plague and hunger.  There are bazaars to visit to purchase supplies and assistants for the quest.  There are uncharted territories to get lost in and tombs and ruins to plunder.  And there is a mighty army to be raised before the player can lay seige to the tower and fight either to glorious victory or crushing defeat.&#10;&#10;Dated and primitive by today's standards, Dark Tower was nevertheless an astonishing achievement when it was released in 1981.  Every aspect of the game was monitored by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself, an unheard of innovation at the time.  Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors.  It could even play recognizable pieces of music at significant points during the game.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "30    Along the lines of HeroQuest comes a much more heavily produced game called Dark World. One player is the evil lord who controls the dungeon in which the rest of the players move their characters from room to room, fighting monsters and gaining treasure.

       "10504 In Dungeon Rush, players are adventurers rushing through a perilous dungeon to root out evil, earning coins and improving their abilities along the way. After three levels (3 rounds of monsters in each level) they face the Dungeon Lord and the Dragon.&#10;&#10;Each player has two heroes, one for your right and one for your left hand. Players simultaneously reveal 2 dungeon cards each and quickly put their hands on the cards they want their heroes to fight. If you win you claim the card as loot and/or equipment that increases the abilities of your hero. Equipment cards are placed partly under your hero card, with the ability symbol sticking out. This way the 4 different types of abilities (Melee, Ranged, Magic and Stealth) are built up in one direction each, out from your hero.&#10;&#10;For particularly strong monsters your heroes can combine their power, by hitting the monster with both your hands.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "10505 Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The tourist season is fast approaching. As a mansion owner, you've come to the Freak Shop to stock your mansion with the horrors that will guarantee that your visitors have a most unforgettable stay!&#10;&#10;Freak Shop is a short and simple tactical card game for 2 to 5 players that relies on a tricky trade mechanism. All cards in the game represent the frightening things, with values going from 1 to 10, that any real good freaky mansion owner must have in their collection. Players begin with four cards in their mansion (personal area), and cards are available in the Freak Shop (common zone at the center of the table). Each player's aim is to have their mansion worth the most fear points when the Freak Shop closes, with points coming from a combination of three randomly chosen objectives. To achieve this, they try to make the best trades between cards currently in their mansion and cards available in the Shop so that their collection grows in both quantity and value, while also best fitting the objectives.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you make one single trade between cards currently in your mansion and cards available in the Shop. To do that, you have the choice between two options:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Sell at the fair price =&gt; Trade any number of cards totaling a given value for any number of cards worth exactly the same total value. &#10;     Get a good deal =&gt;  Exchange a series of cards of one single value with a series of the same number of cards of another single value.&#10;&#10;&#10;Throughout a game of Freak Shop, you try to take the best trade opportunities each turn to first make your mansion grow, then ensure that you can end with the collection worth the most points. Good deals help to get higher value cards, and fair price trades help to get more cards in your mansion. As everything is about trades, a central strategic point is to determine which cards are better used for optimizing new trades instead of being kept for scoring!&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "10506 Ambition and a thirst for wealth have driven humanity to strive for ever greater progress. In America, during the 19th century, battles were waged between huge railway corporations that sought to connect state to state and coast with coast&hellip; making themselves filthy rich in the process. Railroad Revolution drops you straight into the middle of these tempestuous years; a time that changed America forever.&#10;&#10;In Railroad Revolution, you will manage your own railroad company, ruthlessly competing to be the most powerful railroad tycoon across all America. You will build railroads, establish stations in your connected cities, expand the network of telegraph lines, and chase your objectives, increasing the value of your company with every action you take.&#10;&#10;You start with mainly a team of non-specialized workers, but during the game you can hire additional ones with specific skill sets. The cost or effect of an action is determined by the type of worker that does it. To complete your company objectives, you will have to remove some of your workers from your active pool, promoting them to managerial positions. You must carefully assign each of your workers to perform the right action at the right time in order to exploit their specializations in the best way. You need to decide which ones to promote and which are instead still needed to take actions, as your priorities will change from turn to turn.&#10;&#10;Railroad Revolution is a fast paced game with relatively simple rules, and it provides you with interesting and challenging decisions. Having a good strategy and finding the correct timing to implement it, is the key to winning the game.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "10507 In Hounded, players will either be the cunning fox, trying to elude capture, or the determined hunter, trying to hunt down the fox.&#10;&#10;In the game. each player moves their pawns and turns over tiles as they do, sometimes triggering effects and sometimes not. While the fox character is alone, the hunter has a team of hounds to help him hunt the fox. All the hunter has to do to win is either corner the fox with his dogs or force the fox to end his turn next to the hunter himself. For the fox to win, it has to run out the clock, which is done by either finding the three timepiece tiles or flipping over 43 of the 49 tiles. Once time runs out, the hunter has to retire for the day and the fox escapes!&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "10508 After many millennia, Hypnos is leaving the throne. Now it belongs to the Morpheus, Hypnos' right hand and son. Morpheus must make sure that dreams leave Oniria to the world and minds of mortals at the same rate as to this moment, otherwise Earth is doomed to regress of thinking and Oniria &ndash; to annihilation. Mortals need dreams to think, remember and stimulate their imagination, Oniria needs sleeping humans to exist &ndash; without dreamers Oniria will be left without power. But Morpheus cannot rule Kingdom of Dreams and create dreams and send them alone. That is why he needs an assistant.  He makes a competition &ndash; Dreamweavers have three months (this is rather foggy, time in Oniria works &ndash; like most things &ndash; differently than in mortal world) to weave the most dreams with the most powerful oniric energies &ndash; the best weaver will become Morpheus&rsquo; right hand, and simultaneously second most powerful creature in Oniria.&#10;&#10;Morpheus is a game for 2-4 players in which players will create dreams. At the beginning of each turn, the active player rolls the dice. Then, players will choose the dice and according to the number they will get different gifts, with essence among them. After that, at certain locations Dreamweavers can assign the essence to dreams and completing them. Other gifts include Chronite, a rare mineral able to bend time, used as a currency and Onirite, a device which can bend the structure of Oniria, allowing players to take additional actions. Dreamweavers will travel through the land of Oniria exactly three months of game-time, which equals 21 turns. The board is randomly assembled from tiles and dreamweavers will go a full circle from location to location. Player who creates the most powerful dreams and collects the most victory points wins the game and becomes right hand and assistant of Morpheus.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "10511 Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Quartermaster General: 1914 is the next title in the critically acclaimed Quartermaster General series by Ian Brody and creates a narrative of the First World War in Europe, reflecting the military, technological, and social changes that occurred over the following four years.&#10;&#10;In Quartermaster General: 1914, each card has two different uses: one when played, and another when prepared. On your turn, you have the opportunity to both play and prepare a card. You can also spend cards to draft more troops, or use cards to attrition your opponents. However, your deck represents your overall resources, so moving too quickly through your deck early might result in your unsupported armies being swept away in the final rounds of the game. This is worth it if you can capture Berlin or Paris in 1915, but if your gambit fails, you may have a tough road ahead.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 17 rounds of play, or earlier if one side has a commanding lead.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "10512 This is a new edition of the Spiel des Jahres-nominated dice game.  In this version everything is bigger, the players have boards with dry erase markers in place of the original paper and pencil.  This edition is also for up to 8 players instead of only 5 in the original game.  The biggest change in this edition, though, is that on the back of the regular player boards are the Qwixx Mixx boards which have the colors scrambled throughout the different lines, which changes many of the strategies while keeping the mechanisms largely the same.&#10;&#10;The rules for Qwixx:&#10;&#10;Qwixx is a quick-playing dice game in which everyone participates, no matter whose turn it is. Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player rolls six dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows, then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that's the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you mark off the 2 or 12 in a row and have at least five numbers marked in that row, you get to also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.&#10;&#10;When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

There also appears to be some large object trying to get out of that sealed box...&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "10514 Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Following the call of the gods, the players settle at the base of mountain Meduris. Building huts, bringing offerings to the druid, gathering precious runestones, and building monumental temples is the only way to earn the favor of the gods in Meduris.&#10;&#10;1. Skillful use of the workers lets you obtain valuable materials. These are needed to build huts and temples.&#10;&#10;2. The larger the settlement,the more expensive it is to build a hut there. But if you can get in the good graces of the druid by presenting an offering, then your effort pays off.&#10;&#10;3. Keep an eye on the other players: Who will secure the best building sites at the right time, and collect the most valuable rune stones?&#10;&#10;4. Only a player who skillfully places their huts and temples, and keeps enough materials ready for the big final round of offerings, will win the game.&#10;&#10;Game description from the publisher:&#10;Dem Ruf der G&ouml;tter folgend, machen sich die Spieler auf, um den Fu&szlig; des Berges M&eacute;duris zu besiedeln.

This is why, before adquiring big treasures, you may want to hire some though guys to help you protect it...&#10;&#10;There are four types of cards in The Treasure of Isla Tortuga:&#10;&#10;     Decks to expand your ship, so you can fit more cards in it.&#10;     Objects that give you extra resources or abilities.&#10;     Treasures, that give you victory points.&#10;     Crew, that either gives you victory points or help you in boardings. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "10517 &quot;You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.&#10;&#10;&quot;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.'&quot;'&#10;&#10;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &quot;buy&quot; as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&#10;&#10;Dominion is not a collectible card game (CCG), but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 26 Kingdom card types to include in any given play&mdash;leading to immense variety.&#10;&#10;Dominion (Second Edition) replaces six Kingdom card types from the first edition with six new types of Kingdom cards, while also replacing the blank cards in the game with a seventh new Kingdom card. These new cards are available on their own in the Dominion: Update Pack. The rulebook has been rewritten, three cards have mild functional changes (&quot;you may&quot; added to Moneylender, Mine, Throne Room), and other cards have been rephrased (while remaining functionally the same).&#10;&#10;Dominion: Update Pack contains the seven new kingdom cards introduced in the second edition of Dominion, thereby allowing owners of the first edition to obtain these new cards without needing to repurchase the entire game.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "10518 Gwent is a standalone card game included inside the Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt videogame by CD Projekt Red. It was available as a physical copy with the Xbox One Collector's Edition of the video game (Northern Realms and Nilfgaardian Empire factions), in &quot;Hearts of Stone&quot;physical expansion for PC/PS4 (Scoia'Tel and Monsters factions) and with the purchase of the Season Pass giving you the opportunity to ask for redeem code to buy both limited editions versions on CD Projekt Red merchandising store.&#10;&#10;Gwent has two players simulating a war between two of four factions: Northern Realms, Scoia'Tael, Monsters, or Nilfgaardian Empire. Players take turns adding strength to the battlefield until both players pass. The highest strength on the battlefield wins the round and matches are played best of three, with little to no card drawing in between rounds. Special cards may also be played to reduce the effect of certain unit types.

Chances of a global economic crisis or geopolitical power shifts may ruin your investments.&#10;&#10;The game is set in a complex and dynamic global economy, where profitable industries, interest rates, global growth and geopolitical landscape change constantly and the scepter of an economic crisis always present. Players must analyze and influence these new trends. The world's superpowers may compete for world dominance but you care little about the grand chessboard, except when your profits are concerned!&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "10521 Timeline: British History is a card game played using 109 cards. Each card depicts an event on both sides, with the year in which that it occured on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.&#10;&#10;Timeline: British History can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "10522 Steal This Game was designed by D&aacute;vid Turczi on the spot at SPIEL 2016 after an unfortunate incident left the publisher a full cash box short.&#10;&#10;This nanogame, playable by two players in five minutes or less, fits on a postcard (with two dice supplied by the players). The players take turns being robbers and exhibitors at a board game trade fair &mdash; rolling dice, lying, guessing, and shuffling cards.&#10;&#10;The exhibitor tries to hide cash in one of the cash boxes and keep it hidden - shell game style. The robber secretly rolls a pair of dice and then tries to make increasingly risky moves to gain more information about the location of the cash and move the clerk away from the full cash box. If the exhibitor catches the thief in a lie, the thief must immediately risk stealing from a cash box without additional information.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

They can also establish business branches that give them advantages during play, in addition to the half-dozen special cards that every player holds at the start of play.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "10525 Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Blood Bowl is a game of Fantasy Football. The basic game features a match between two teams drawn from a number of fantasy archetypes, playing a warped version of American Football.&#10;&#10;The Blood Bowl boxed game contains two teams: Humans, an all-round team who are flexible enough to adapt to any style of play, or Orcs, who make up in brute force what they lack in finesse. The teams are represented by coloured plastic miniatures, and push-fit assembly is required before use. The game is expandable, and additional rules and teams will be made available through expansion sets and supplements.&#10;&#10;Actions in the game are resolved through the use of dice. Regular six-sided dice are used to make tests in a number of cases, such as when a player attempts to pick up the ball, pass it, catch it or dodge past an enemy player. Custom dice are used when one player wishes to Block another, using graphics to represent each of the different (but all violent) potential outcomes.&#10;&#10;The rules in this edition of Blood Bowl are almost identical to those found in the Competition Rules Pack, which was the culmination of several years of development of the Blood Bowl Living Rulebook. This has resulted in an incredibly well-honed game which sees regular competition play around the world. In fact each team takes turns moving, blocking and advancing the football down the field. The game comes with plastic miniatures.&#10;&#10;This game is a part of the Blood Bowl Series.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "10526 Qwixx: Das Duell is a stand alone two player version of Qwixx.&#10;&#10;As in Qwixx, players roll colored dice and match them up to fill out a score sheet to maximize how many points they will score at the end of the game. However in this game, rolls can only be used by the active player, but the players will share the same score board and mark their progression with stones of their player color.&#10;&#10;Stones can in some cases be &quot;bumped&quot; out by the other player, while other stones are &quot;locked&quot; in permanently. As so, Qwixx: Das Duell features a higher level of player interaction than Qwixx.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players sum up their scores based on the placent of their stones. The player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

The major changes involve patrols, ambushes, landing zones, and the 1st Cav Brigade HQ, while minor changes tweak movement, combat, and coordination game mechanics to showcase radically different strengths and weaknesses the FWA and NVA force brought to the battles in the Ia Drang Valley.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

To do this, players build up an army of units and heroes. Players determine the exact composition of their armies as they play by adding cards to their deck based on the tech they've chosen to pursue.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "10530 Time to walk about town and take some pictures! It's the 1960s in Japan, and you have a half-size camera that lets you take half-size vertical pictures. Let's see whether you can put together good shots...&#10;&#10;In Wind the Film!, you're trying to organize pictures on your roll so that they appear in the right order. Each player has a hand of cards, and on a turn, you'll add 1-3 cards to the front of your hand (without changing their order), move one card in your hand closer to the front, then discard as many cards from the back of your hand as the number of cards that you added. When the sunset card comes out, you can take no more pictures, and everyone scores for what's on their camera.&#10;&#10;The cards all have numbers and colors on them, and you try to line them up in hand to score the most points possible.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "10531 The race is on for the robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory who work long, hard days at the assembly line building high&#226;&#128;&#144;speed supercars, but never get to see them in action. On Saturday nights, the factory comes to life as the ultimate race course with treacherous obstacles and rival sabotage. In Robo Rally, players move their robots through the course by speeding through corridors and dodging traps to reach each checkpoint first. Only the strongest robots survive!&#10;&#10;Enter the world of mad machines and dangerous schemes in the Robo Rally board game. Players control their robot with game cards which reveal directions on how the robots can move through the hectic Robo Rally automobile factory. Use strategy to outsmart rival robots while racing towards each checkpoint in your chosen course in numerical order. Beware of factory obstacles such as industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts that can make or break the race.&#10;&#10;The 2016 edition of Robo Rally differs from earlier versions in a number of ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Players each now have their own deck of twenty cards, with the same cards in each deck. On a turn, a player draws nine cards from their deck, programs five of the cards, then discards the rest. Two cards says &quot;Again&quot; and repeat the action programmed in the previous slot; one card says &quot;Energy&quot; and gives a energy cube which you can use to buy options.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Since each player has their own deck, the cards no longer have priority numbers to determine who moves first. Now movement order is determined by whoever is closest to a transmitter on the game board.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Players start with a hand of three option cards and five energy. Each option card has an energy cost, and you can purchase additional option cards for the cost of two energy each. Players can earn energy by programming it, by being the first to a pitstop, or by starting their turn on a pitstop.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    When players are damaged, they no longer receive one less card for each damage (or have one of their program registers locked) at the start of a round; instead they receive damage cards that will be shuffled into their decks. &quot;Normal&quot; damage from the board or a robot laser gives you &quot;spam&quot; damage. When you program one of these cards, you remove it from play at the appropriate time and replace it in the register with the top card from your deck. Surprise! Other types of damage exist, with a Trojan horse granting you two spam, a virus infecting nearby players, and a worm forcing you to reboot, which gives you even more damage. By playing the damage, though, you remove it from your deck.&#10;&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
